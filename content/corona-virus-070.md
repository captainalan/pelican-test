A chilly November breeze pushes fallen leaves across quiet suburban
streets. For the most part, the city scape is still. The robots are
still doing their robot things&mdash;traffic lights will change when
proper stimuli are applied, on some streets you can smell gasoline and
hear leaf blowers, and the glow of television screens can be seen
through the windows of many homes.

Certain "hand-crafts" have been revitalized, in a way. Pumpkin
carvings, political signs with familiar slogans, and the continued
work of restaurants and food delivery people will occasionally break
the stillness of a suburban walk.

Dog-driven exercise/socialization can be seen&mdash;perhaps the
majority of other walking people I see outside are doing some form of
pet care. Cats rolling around on the floor and making interesting
shapes continue to be cats.
