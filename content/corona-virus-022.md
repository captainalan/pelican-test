In today's blog post, I'm just going to ramble loosely around the
theme of "abstractions and reality". Gotta keep up momentum writing
stuff, even if some pieces are much better than others...

Getting humans into outer space
-------------------------------

Today SpaceX didn't get to launch a manned spacecraft into orbit
because the weather conditions didn't permit it. Conditions for
safe/successful flight were not met, so this launch was held off.

Stuff like *the weather* will always be with us; water, wind, sunlight
etc.&mdash;sometimes, from our cities with climate control we can
largely abstract these things away and turn our attention to other
education, entertainment, and everything in between.

However, when faced with a *very physically challenging task*, like
getting humans into space&mdash;well we must answer reality again. We
can control the weather in our living spaces to a large degree, but
we can't climate control the entire observable universe.

Policy, Software, Law...
------------------------

Much of the order imposed on the world is through human "layers of
abstraction". If you learn a lot about how some policy works, some
software application works, or some law works, you learn about a
particular *human-created configuration* for things, which is
different from learning about the weather or biology.

Placed on a desert island and forced to survive with only a hatchet or
something... what help does knowledge of California law, Photoshop, or
your health insurance policy provide you? Insofar as these things
help; you recognize useful categories in the world and train skills in
reckoning with reality, they are useful. Beyond that, they are
*locally valuable* (only) in the sense that they can help you in a
particular time and place because people have decided to place value
on them, but this scope of worth does not extend to the metaphorical
desert island.

The computer programer without a computer may have some skills to
systematize operations and get things up and running efficiently. But
this person's specialized skills in keyboarding, hardware
this-and-that esoteric knowledge, idiosyncratic know-how about
such-and-such programing language or library&mdash;these things are
taken away.

However, skills in something abstract/fuzzy like "critical thinking"
or "problem solving" need concrete applications to be trained. This is
an (obvious?) reason why it isn't stupid to acquire a lot of
specialized knowledge, because it is in succeeding in some domain
(even human-created) that we train a more general fitness. 

California continues opening up
-------------------------------

The Season of COVID-19 has brought in a new "local scope" of altered
social norms. Health care workers got a boost in prestige. "Conspiracy
thinking" got extra-demonized as media companies (including primarily
Internet-based ones) chose dug into their ideological/geopolitical
trenches. Some relatively introverted people have been having a really
great time while some tortured extroverts have turned to committing
misdemeanors to keep themselves from punching holes in walls. 

Through all of this, I see the "reality" (or *biology*) of the whole
COVID-19 situation is still far from clear/resolved.

Among other reasons, this is why I have focused by blog here I'm what
I'm thinking, pscyhologizing, and speculating versus trying to tell
you all *the facts* about what is going on. I still think we don't
know much; though, I think that many of the ideas I've been writing
about here have been useful to me navigating these difficult times.
