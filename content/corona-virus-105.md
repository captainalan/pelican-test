I've been doing some learning on digital media&mdash;graphics, video editing
and so on. There's tons of money going into this stuff because we're all being
made to interface with the world through what academics call **Computer
Mediated Communication**.

There's some more spooky angles to this&mdash;people in developed countries are
being physically isolated (remember "**(deep) social distancing**") from
another and asked to get all of their information through digital channels such
as news websites, YouTube, and so on. What this means is that we are expected
to trust a description of reality based on second-hand sources. Truly, we don't
*know* that the things we see on TV or in the movies are as *they are presented
to us*.

Researching **advertising** or "how to lie with statistics" or even magic (as
in showmen/illusionists) will show you how a lot of deception is done *at
scale*.

To better understand stuff, an approach I've been taking is to *see how stuff
is done*. So for example, you might here all this hype about "cloud computing".
Anybody can go look up information about how this stuff is *actually* put
together and see behind the corporate buzzwords.

This is real education&mdash;learning how things work so you can properly
discern what is legit and what isn't.
