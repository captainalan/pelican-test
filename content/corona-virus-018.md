Today's high will be 80 degrees Fahrenheit; by next Wednesday we will
have a high of 105 degrees Fahrenheit [^1]. Looks like stuff is
heating up! [^2] As the summer heats rolls around, will people readily
accept the "new normal" of locked-in life as they wish to stay where
the air conditioning is anyways?

To feel the heat is to be reminded of nature&mdash;the stuff that
civilization shields us from. To find a cold shower refreshing is to
re-create some of the experience of jumping into a refreshingly cool
lake.

Humans did not evolve to sit in ergonomic chairs for 8-ish hours a
day [^3]; we are optimized to forage, to hunt, and to form groups (tribes).
When we are bored, we paint, make music, and play
sports/games. Through these activities, we learn to obey rules/norms,
respect our competition, and resolve conflicts. Also, we have fun.

By being clever with abstractions some of us can convince their bodies
that they are doing the aforementioned activities. Dueling with mind
power at work then going to an intense workout afterwords may be
sufficiently convince the body that one has planned and executed a
successful hunting expedition.

The above thoughts are not original; they have, for instance, been
(in)famously recorded in *Industrial Society and Its Future* by
Theodore "Uncle Ted" Kaczynski. [^4]

In his chapter
["Surrogate Activities"](http://xahlee.org/p/um/um-s06.html),
Kaczynski describes how some people are able to find fulfillment in
activities that aren't immediately useful to their survival like
hunting is,

> 38. But not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and
>     demoralized. For example, the emperor Hirohito, instead of

>     biology, a field in which he became distinguished. When people
>     do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs
>     they often set up artificial goals for themselves. In many cases
>     they then pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional
>     involvement that they otherwise would have put into the search
>     for physical necessities...

During all this COVID-19 stuff, we'll see images/news
articles/etc. saying how "easy" it is just sit on the couch and "do
nothing" while such-and-such heroes solve this pandemic for us. Why
should anyone complain when they are being asked to do something so
simple?

Uncle Ted elaborates,

>     other than the need to have some goal to pursue...

What is happening for many people during lock-down is that they are
*doubly* locked-down. First, is the normal lock-down of socialization
(which involves turning natural instincts to surrogate
activities). Now, as many of these surrogate activities are taken
away, people are asked to... ...watch others doing surrogate
activities? Play video games to simulate some surrogate activities?

## Facing the heat

Choosing to not turn on the AC is decisive step in *facing the
heat*&mdash;re-engaging "natural" human struggle. Most of us are not
farmers, hunters, and the like&mdash;we are deeply embedded in
industrial society. It is not difficult to imagine why this is very
difficult for those of us who are not particularly abstraction-adept,
introverted, obedient and/or already off the grid somewhere.

Actively choosing to face (physical) difficulties of various sorts is
a step towards re-engaging the human knack for problem solving,
community formation, etc. Problems with motivation are "irrational"
insofar as we uncritically believe the axioms handed down to us by
depressed happiness researchers.

Returning to slowly *observe* and learn from direct sensation rather
than words, words, and more words is a step towards reconnecting with
reality. If words are needed, texts at least 100 years old are
preferrable for wisdom, informally published stuff by laypeople (like
yours truly) is good fun for the "modern" stuff ðŸ˜›
