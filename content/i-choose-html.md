title: I choose HTML

Before, I built [my website in
React](https://captainalan.github.io/me). Now, it is being rebuilt in
plain HTML/CSS (with some help from Bootstrap and jQuery to make
things like mobile responsiveness less tedious). After spending a
considerable amount of time with fancy frameworks, why take a step
"backwards"?

(Story about using Trisquel and seeing my own site being
blocked)

It is my goal to produce informative, unobtrusive websites
that are easily indexed, linked, downloaded, etc.
