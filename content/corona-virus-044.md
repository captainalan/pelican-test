Today, I'll be discussing the topic of *content*&mdash;  
I've done intentional stepping away (physically) from rando Internet browsing,
learning, etc., making use instead of:

- Communications: what links do other *people* send me (not search engines)
- Books/resources I already have

The goal is to better make use of the resources/tools I already have instead of
wasting my time looking for new things or quick, "one off" solutions to
problems which may pop up again.

People over search engines
==========================

One of the reasons for getting links from other people is that you are
accessing content which you know at least *one* other person at least sort of
cares about. This is to ensure that link clicking and stuff isn't a solipsistic
activity. The act of going through other people to click links

Also, there is **reciprocity**. Other people will often appreciate it if you
take the time to take a look at stuff that interests them, make comments, etc.
Internet media becomes more social when you ditch search engines when possible

Blogging as a resource
======================

I write these blogs to remember *processes* I went through; this can include
thinking about issues as well as technical stuff I've figured out...
