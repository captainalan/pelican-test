Lunch for today was "survival stew". Similar to Korean 부대 찌개 "Army
Stew", it consisted of whatever ingredients were available, served
with some rice. Ah! The taste of *austerity*.

This time, it didn't taste excellent, but that's how stuff goes. Every
meal every time doesn't need to be excellent; sometimes we just have
better/worse ingredients available.

This cooking experience reminds me of something I am trying to do in
other domains of life. That is...

### tl;dr

Getting comfortable with standard tools
---------------------------------------

Historically, there have been different *schools* or *styles* of
cooking. Different regions of planet earth had different ingredients
available, different cultural taboos, etc. And so cuisines developed
around core ingredients and time-tested methods to make those
ingredients taste good, kill disease, etc.

Cooking is very daunting if you are always jumping around trying to
make this-and-that culture's ingredients. You may even find yourself
buying specialized tools for all sorts of specific tasks (e.g. a torch
thing for *Crème brûlée*, a fancy wok for some South Chinese style
stir-fry).

In a similar way, it pays to learn some standard tools well in other
domains. Jumping around and chasing diversity ("spreading yourself too
thin") is *no bueno*.

- **Computer**: lots of unix things; computer science fundamentals
- **Music**: Look at common, well-regarded music. Don't get lost in
  equipment. Focus on core skills...
- **Languages**: standard usage; common colloquial stuff (don't go down
  rabbit hole of dialects and stuff unless you have a specific social
  reason to do so)

Knowing the "vanilla" defaults well gives you more freedom because you
can only make variations of the "default" when you *first know the
default*.

Literary Aside
--------------

What good are novels/movies/etc. flipping over narratives left and
right when the main audience no longer knows the default narrative?
The overly flipped narratives become the default narrative. And
suddenly the old dusty book has the edgy take.
