Today I didn't get around to doing more reading into different
branches of Christianity, *but I did finish reading Harry Potter*.
(I've been writing reviews on
[goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136251.Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows).)

I can't experience these books with a completely "open mind" because
I've been trained to think about different genres and other meta
literature this and that&mdash;search "philosophy of literature" if
you're interested in this topic more...

In short, I would say that the Harry Potter series is very
*entertaining*. There are likeable characters and the books are very
readable. You could call them "page turners".

Whether or not they reveal valuable information about the nature of
the universe or human interactions, that is a different question. For
the millennial generation, they are definitely culturally significant,
but I am not sure if they will be for subsequent generations.

I don't feel a particular desire to (re-)watch the movies after
reading the books, though I would if there were some social reasons
for doing so.

I hope everyone has been having a good Sunday. For me, it has been
pretty relaxing&mdash;talking with some folks on the Internet and
catching up with studying various things.
