title: Corona Virus Diary, Part 29

Last post I discussed some ways to do "digital
prepping"&mdash;basically getting your computers/devices to be useful
to you even when you are offline. [^1] Being prepared to move and work
in different environments is a way to transcend being locked into any
one particular arrangement that can compromise things that are
important to you. [^2] If you found yourself working for a large
corporation in a big city with very high living costs&mdash;you may
become a very unfree person if you have savings and other preparations
ready so that you can relocate at will. [^3] With shifting political
tides, dramatic economic ups and downs, etc. what guarantees do you
expect in such an environment?

Except for the most invaluable specialist (e.g. expertise maintaining
some essential system running some arcane technology; being a licensed
professional in a high-demand area), becoming overly embedded in a
system of which you exert little control is a dangerous gamble of
indentured servitude.

Property ownership and building stuff
-------------------------------------

On the other hand, once you own property or have a network established
in area, you have an interested to sink your roots maximally deep
there. It becomes more efficient to settle and develop oneself in some
area and *not* be concerned with the many costs of moving around and
dealing with urban politics/logistics.

This is one reason why the internment of Japanese people (including US
citizens) in the US was a big deal; particularly for agriculturally
minded people, being settled in a "homeland" is important for building
up lots of stuff.

It is no surprise while we see many different groups interested in
defending their homelands, whether this is ethnic neighborhoods or
religious freedom.

Nomadic, Diaspora Thinking
--------------------------

I realize that this sort of thinking I opened this post with is
characteristic of someone without a relatively fixed community or home
base to build up.

*Not* having land (or a family) to build stuff on encourages an
itinerate lifestyle and non-committal attitudes towards the well-being
of "the commons"&mdash;you can see this for yourself by visiting
university dorms at least midway through an academic term. Students
are paying high prices to stay at these dorms, but are expected on
being kicked out in a timely basis and charged for whatever damages
management can find. Students likewise can expect to extract
themselves from any bad living arrangements within the terms of their
lease. So if there are hostilities with other people in dorm/apartment
complexes it can be more time efficient to *not* solve problems since
there is little "long run" to worry about.

Reciprocity and Asymmetrical Arrangements
-----------------------------------------

Expecting reciprocity (a "symmetrical" arrangement) is a feature of a
high-trust society. If you treat others well, do you expect them to
likewise treat you well? Relatively trusting, kind natured people will
expect that their concessions, symbolic deference (e.g. *kowtow*ing)
and other actions inviting reconciliation will make things better. 

This is conditional on the other parties involved. For example, a
tenant and a landlord may very well be incentivized to work out some
dispute about a payment because the landlord has other things to
attend to and would prefer to not go through the trouble of eviction
and likewise a tenant would rather not accrue legal costs and other
badness in addition to whatever issues they are facing. On the other
hand, we would call it
[simping](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Simp) if a
man contunally tried to win a woman's favor with repeated
non-reciprocation of affection.

Looking around the neighborhood
-------------------------------

Walking down the street, I see written in chalk in front of someone's
house,

> THE PANDEMIC IS NOT OVER

...I see tons of rainbow flags (probably more than US flags), and many
BLM sympathetic signs of various sorts. And I perceive hostility in
all directions&mdash;people bunkering down in their houses repeating
slogans and symbols fed to them by the media. What do you want me to
think? That I am in a tolerant neighborhood surrounded by a bunch of
good folks?

What do I think?

> I bet most of u are pretty okay to hang out with most of the time;

> caring for interpersonal relationships with the people in your

I feel more connection with the fellow jogger near me who has to cross
to the other side of the street to avoid an out of control barking dog
than I do with these media slogan repeaters. Working from home?! Laid
off from your job? It is invigorating to see people using this
opportunity to make things better for themselves and by extension
those they maintain contact with.

My unsolicited advice to many people would be to

> Study and analyze the news as propaganda (you can even agree with
> many of the messages) or shut it off. Don't passively absorb it or
> you will be miserable.

But I'm not about to give unsolicited advice to strangers in the
middle of a race war which some are trying to escalate into a Marxist
class struggle involving everyone, everywhere.

This Corona Virus Diary (unfortunately) continues!

    free software and connect to public library wifi or something, at
    least once social distancing mandates are done
[^2]: For instance, being on the academic job market may mean that you
    don't have much choice about where you work (you gotta take the
    first position you can get if you are aiming to do pretty
    specialized sorts of work).
