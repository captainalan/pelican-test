There is escalating civil unrest across many cities in America today.
Cities&mdash;as has been mentioned on this blog&mdash;are sites where
the intoxication of words and the influence of mass media are
strongest. Cities are where people are free to live in abstractions,
not answering to the challenges (and truth) of the natural world.
Cities are often where people go to get money, but oftentimes that
money comes at the price of losing touch with reality.

Greeks and Romans
-----------------

I'm reading some stuff about Greeks and Romans. Recall that Romans
came after the Greeks and adapted many elements of Greek
cultures. However, Romans in many ways were practically-minded and
scheming politicians&mdash;skilled in agrarian and military
things&mdash;rather than idle philosophers and poets. [^1]

Living in a suburb, I am glad that I have at least some connection
with the "natural world" beyond the concrete jungle of a city. I have
access to a yard and some nice streets to pace around on as well...

I wish more people could just take some time off and go hiking in the
mountains or something. Breath in the nice mountain air... struggle
and be out of breath facing a natural barrier (e.g. gravity and slope
of a mountain) rather than constructing ideological enemies...

SpaceX Rocket Launch
--------------------

In the USA today also, we got a SpaceX rocket launch. What a nice,
positive thing for all sorts of people to celebrate.

If you are getting too political, I advise you to shut up and learn
some technical skills and improve relationships with the people around
you. Upon doing that, you can use your big brane to make the world a
better place through organizing labor and developing better ways to do
things and you will have fun with friends/family while you're at it. [^2]

[^1]: There is a lot more research for me to do here, but this is the
    general pattern as I understand it. Greeks had a lot more
    plurality/diversity in the form of many city states... Romans did
    more empire building.
[^2]: Most people I know who are "overly political" in my opinion are
    left-leaning folks pushed into constant angst by the legacy media.
    There are some right-leaning people that are similarly "overly
    political" in the sense that they want to implement their morality
    into law... My personal opinion is that we should de-escalate
    state power to the best of our ability such that there is no giant
    gun lying on the floor for various political actors to wrestle
    over. Insofar as the power of the state grows, so the potential
    destruction your political opposition can wield increases. Let's
    "de-escalate" and chill out, allowing decentralized progress and
    peace.
