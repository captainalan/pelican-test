title: Chairs suck.

I personally dislike chairs and mattresses (for sitting and sleeping,
respectively). Most days, I use my chair as a laptop stand while using
an external keyboard and sleep on the floor.

Chairs are useful if you are wearing shoes, don't plan on taking them
off, and want to sit down.
