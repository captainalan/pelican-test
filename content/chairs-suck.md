title: Chairs suck.

I personally dislike chairs and mattresses (for sitting and sleeping,
respectively). Most days, I use my chair as a laptop stand while using
an external keyboard and sleep on the floor. Blarrghh!!!

Chairs are useful if you are wearing shoes, don't plan on taking them
off, and want to sit down.

Many common clothing items we wear were designed for purposes quite
unlike modern living. For example, long pants came from horse-riding. Few people these days ride horses.

(Hot weather, cold weather...)
