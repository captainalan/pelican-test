Aside from work, I spent some time today investigating (Theravada)
Buddhism by reading *In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses
from the Pali Canon*, which I bought used a while back. [^1]
I had this book on the shelf for a while and was interested in reading
something a bit more ancient the 20th century stuff and contemporary
things I've been reading lately.

To the best of my knowledge, I don't have any Buddhism stuff in my
direct line of descent, though it is such an old way of doing things,
I would be surprised if there wasn't any going back into my Chinese
ancestry. [^2] Mainly, I'm looking into these things out of
curiosity and for knowledge&mdash;I'm not trying to "convert" or
anything.

Impressions
-----------

Below are some of my impressions&mdash;a practicing Buddhist may want
to reach out to me and correct my misunderstandings here. What follows
is an outsider's perspective.

### Tiers

One thing interesting about Buddhism compared with the Christianity I
know is that Buddhism is a very much "choose your own adventure" type
of religion. Practitioners of Buddhism may be lay people that try to
suffer and aquire good *kamma* (Sanskrit: Karma) by following "best
practices", *or* they can live life in super hard mode and strive for
"release" from the sufferings of this world.

Many recommendations for lay people reminded me of Confucian
ideas&mdash;defining proper relations between different sorts of
people (e.g. Children and Parents, Husbands and Wives). This is on one
hand unsurprising, but also has got me thinking about *how Buddhism
became very popular in China* during various times/places in Chinese
history.

### Doing nothing

Compared with Christianity, it seems that Buddhism supports a lot
of... inaction. In Christiandom, the *Protestant work ethic* is
(in)famous&mdash;industriousness is valued not only for the products
of work in of itself but also as a means for fighting against
temptation and sin.

In contrast, Buddhism has *meditation* as a central practice. Poverty,
homelessness, and being at the charity of others are required for
pursuing Buddha-dom.

Rather than having an integration of serious religious practitioners
and "normal" working/daily life, Buddhism divides "serious"
practitioners from lay practioners, and the *professionals* are
devoted full-time to practices which do not directly contribute *work*
to society (e.g. by producing food).

### Starting from the self

It seems lots of stuff in Buddhism you are supposed to do because *it
makes sense to do in order to reduce suffering*. There is a kind of
empirical, internal justification that I think has appealed to many
Westerners. [^3] From a Christian perspective, this may make a lot of
Buddhism seem rather... **amoral** (c.f. *(im)moral*).

More to come as I study more; these are some quick initial thoughts.

[^2]: I never had any contact with relatives *in China* to the best of
    my knowledge; seems I am many generations back Chinese-American
    (3+). Before widespread literacy and such it is harder to trace
    back further than that.
[^3]: Getting into Buddhism has a long history in the West it seems;
    may have to look more into stories of this
