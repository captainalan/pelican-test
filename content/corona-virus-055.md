We can define **positive thinking** as actively directing one's
attention towards some goal (e.g. striving for that which is
beautiful). Positive thinking can be contrasted with **reactionary
thinking**&mdash; simply *responding* to bad news rather than actively
working *towards* something.

## Language Learning

Allow me to provide an example from language learning, a topic of at
least a few posts here. Now, the goal of most language learners of
modern languages is to gain communicational competence and hopefully
"sound native" in some target language.

The positive thinking learner focues on *what being a speaker of that
target language* is. The most obvious way to do this is to *observe
the language being used*. Real life face-to-face conversations are
best for learning conversation, of course, but videos, podcasts, and
other forms of media are pretty good too&mdash;and often more
convenient when native speakers are readily available on a day-to-day
basis.

Positive thinking involves getting an increasingly clear idea of what
"using XYZ" language is. A person that does not speak Icelandic could
not give you examples of what Icelandic language usage is like because
they don't speak Icelandic.

What would negative thinking look like with respect to language
learning? Being focused on *finding one's errors* and then coming up
with rules and explanations for why such and such is wrong would be
one way to see this.[^1]

Some rather fatalistic viewpoints have been advanced in linguistics.
One such idea is the "critical period"&mdash;there is a certain time
window (usu. ends around age 13 or so) before which a person must
learn a language, or else they will never learn that language
"natively". This is probably true in many respects, particularly if we
involve discussion of trauma and abuse.

However, to tell a 16 year old high student that their Spanish *will
never be "native"* is simply demoralizing and (I think) just plain
false. Resigning to the fact that language learning will be a futile
struggle and that achieving native-like command is impossible is a
recipe to lose sight of a very reachable goal&mdash;visiting YouTube
you can find all sorts of very successful second language learners for
any major language.

## Computer Stuff

Positive thinking is important to empower computer users as well. You
may have met someone who had simply decided, "I'm not a computer
person" or "I don't do technology". [^2] This is a kind of
self-fulfilling prophecy.

While I don't expect everybody to be willing or able to troubleshoot
any computer problem that comes their way (and hence why I don't do
any "UNIX evangelism"), I do think certain workflows are accessible to
anyone who is capable of doing things like writing a short essay or
driving a car. It is not conceptually difficult to understand what it
means to,

- Send and recieve emails or messages on some chat service
- Use some sort of calendar (e.g. Google calendar)
- Do basic word processing/writing (e.g. through MS word, or some
  boomer program like emacs)
- Organize files into folders

Having positive (projects) such as,

- Keeping a daily diary
- Maintaining regular corresponce with some people/groups
- Organizing a digital library

...will inform you on the skills you need to develop.

Solutions often don't need to be complicated. There are professional
programers whose computers are total messes outside of their
programing projects; clearly these people know how to deal with
complexity in some one domain, but they don't readily apply tools they
already know how to use to other more accessible domains. [^3]

[^1]: In linguistics, finding "ungrammatical" sentences uses this
    approach.
[^2]: If you have principled reasons for not using computers, Internet
    tech, smartphones, etc., I tip my (virtual) fedora to you.
[^3]: For examples of "reformed nerds" you can find many examples of
    engineering types deciding to apply their skills to stuff like
    training as athletes later in their lives when they accept they
    need to work on their physical health.
