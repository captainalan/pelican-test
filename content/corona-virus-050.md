The last post here, I shared that I was interested in investigating Orthodox
Christianity further. So far, it has been an overwhelmingly positive
experience. In this post, I relate one way in which Orthodox Christianity (as
opposed to other varieties I've been involved with, Protestant groups) has thus
far presented itself as a sustainable, robust, *working* system.

Of Arch Linux and Orthodoxy
===========================

The road that led me to do a more serious investigation of Orthodox
Christianity is something as follows, 

- I was aware that Orthodoxy existed from investigating Protestant
  conceptions of the afterlife (heaven/hell), but put these issues on
  the back-burner to take a break from religion and pursue normal
  career stuff
- After four years or so of wandering around in academia, trying to figure
  out what to do with my life, I quit and got normal work doing tech/nerd
  stuff (web programing).
- I joined the [Xah Lee](http://xahlee.info) discord chat server (still active
  there) to have people to chat with about tech/programing and well as general topics.
- One Internet friend I tended to disagree with on a lot of things, continued
  to blame many of the world's ills on Russia

Note, on my web page on
[Russian](https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/languages/russian/index.html)
I mention this:

> Russian often gets a bad reputation in the United States (e.g. "Russian
> collusion"; in contrast, have you heard about "Japanese collusion"?!). One of
> the reasons I'm motivated to study Russian is that many people I tend to
> disagree with on matters of opinion often have an... instinctive dislike for
> Russian. 

...so I looked into some things on Russia to learn just *why* this fellow might
have such strong feelings against Russia. I had overall positive feelings about
Russia at this point because I enjoyed reading Dostoevsky and Tolstoy as an
undergraduate and always liked the sound/look of the Russian language and
Cyrillic script.

Naturally, an investigation into Russia in current times will lead to many
mentions of the Orthodox church.

Another Internet friend recommended me [Jay Dyer's](https://jaysanalysis.com)
content, which I linked on my [previous blog
post](https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-49.html).
Jay does long-form, in-depth analyses of lots of issues including theological
topics.  Jay's content led me to go investigate Orthodoxy in real life as well
as through chatting with friends I met outside the Internet.

So, being a professional nerd (programer) led me to an online chat group, in
which a guy kept on blaming the Russians. This led me to look into Russia which
led me to look into Orthodoxy. Other friends helped link me to various stuff,
share books, etc. Note, much of this searching was done *without Google*.

Linux
-------------

Now it is time to talk about Linux, and in particular my experience with [Arch
Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/). The main way I see using Linux and Orthodox
Christianity is as follows: both give a path for how to *not do wrong* in a
particular domain (i.e. have a working, functional system in Arch Linux; living
a life free of sin in Christianity). Beyond this, the user (*you*) is free to
celebrate the life you've been given through choosing any number of paths. 

Of course there is a big difference of **scope** here (Arch Linux falls under
life; it is certainly possible to sin in a Christian sense while using Arch
Linux, lol). But some interesting parallels do hold, which I will expound on
below.

### Learning stuff

Another person I've linked a bunch is [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz). Luke
Smith unironically has a Christian tech channel. His more interesting stuff to
me are his discussions in his *Not Related!* podcast where he's talked about
stuff like rationality, the scientific method, statistics, and history of the US.
One thing that Luke got me into was setting up Arch Linux; I have basically
transcribed one of his videos into my own [Arch Linux installation
tutorial](https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html).

To learn about using computers/tech, Luke has emphasized many points I agree
with,

- Read the manual/documentation
- Ask questions, see what has been done already
- Don't get caught up in fervor about your new shiny this-or-that; be critical
  of how newer or flashier solutions (e.g. GUI wrapper for some command line
  tool) may *not* be an improvement
- Be humble and learn

Through Luke's content, I came to develop a lot of the views I have on
technology and society. One topic he has touched some on is how to *learn to
use Linux*&mdash;or in internet slang, "git gud". [^1]

Anyone who uses Arch frequently will know of the [Arch
Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), a resource that is so useful that even
non-Arch users will frequently use it to help them troubleshoot issues.

To learn how to do things in Linux, one could try to read all the `man`
(manual) pages for various tools. In earlier decades, it was quite possible to
get a basic sense of what was going on this way. But practically speaking, you
don't want to redo all the work of other people that have already put in
hours and hours troubleshooting issues.

And so, I was pleasantly surprised to find a very well-sourced, readable
[Orthodox Wiki](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Main_Page). Just as someone might
consult the Arch Wiki to find out information on some cryptic command, one
would use the Orthodox Wiki to learn about teachings on some particular issue, 
the history of a particular parish, etc.

Christians (e.g. the Church Fathers) have worked through lots of
problems&mdash;many very deep ones, e.g. metaphysical questions&mdash;over many
centuries. I've been very impressed by the depth and breadth of knowledge
transfer from generation to generation in the Orthodox world.

Going forward
-------------

Here, I document my journey in hopes that it may be useful to others. It is
already interesting for me to look back on my old blog posts during this whole
COVID thing.

Thanks to all my readers who have been following this blog, whether
sporadically or reading every post. 

tbh covid has been pretty fortuitous to me; e.g. it has given me this
opportunity to pause from running around, and think not just about career stuff
for my own life, but to look forward into what kind of life/community I would
like to give future generations.
