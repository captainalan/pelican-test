When reading and studying (physical) books, there is more going on
than just reading *words on a page* which also happens when reading
off of a smartphone or a PC. There is spatial information&mdash;where
some words appear on the page. There is the overall look and feel of
the book. There is the position in the book we note by the feel of the
pages of the book in our hands. All of these things can contribute to
us *remembering*.

Computers and smartphones create a kind of unified window which makes
content *homogenous*. Whereas you would readily be able to tell the
difference between a real oil painting and a cheap print, digital
technology reduces both of these to the same viewing screen. Computer
technology levels everything to `0`s and `1`s.

It is thus unsurprising that it can be difficul tto "judge a book by
its cover" with respect to lots of mass media&mdash;the trashiest of
content can have the highest production value cover. High quality
content might be found on a website that looks like it was made in the
90s when computers were considerably slower than they are today.
