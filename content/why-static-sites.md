Static sites deploy easily, without special considerations about what
will compile, what will be allowed, etc. Everything is packaged up
nicely and good to go. Its like grabbing an an acoustic guitar and
just beginning to play versus doing a complex setup with an electric
guitar. Sure, you can make more different sounds in the latter setup,
but there are also bigger hurdles to overcome if you just want to get
started practicing.
