Today, I got friends visiting from afar. It is a joyous occasion to
have people drive many miles to see me&mdash;to quote Confucius [^1]

I think one good thing that is coming out of all this C'Rona stuff is
that many people have come to question their "old" lifestyles of half
a year or so back and are rediscovering what it is that they value
most.

In my case, I've been given the opportunity to reach out and contact
people in what otherwise might be overly "busy" times.

## Investing in stuff that isn't Federal Reserve notes

Obviously, having lots of dollars in the US is helpful for stuff like
getting food, shelter, transporation, etc.

However, it is not difficult to see how *only* "storing up earthly
treasures" is not a wise solution for the forward looking person. What
if you owned a ton of real estate, and then communists took over? You
would probably either (1) lose your land, or (2) become the corrupt
oligarch you never wanted to become.

What if you went through college, got all A's, but didn't make any
friends/connections? Indeed, that's what a lot of people will probably
do in online schooling these days.
