title: Getting Comfortable with Linux

This tutorial aims to answer this question:

**Now that I have a Linux system running, how do I go about learning more?
(prefarably offline)**

That is, this tutorial is aimed at eager beginners and aspiring computer users
that have decided to no longer be casuals.

## Requirements

In a previous tutorial, I went over [installing Arch
Linux](https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/) based on a video tutorial
by [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/) and information found on the [Arch
Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).

In this tutorial, I assume that you have a Linux system up and running (...and
here, the term "Linux" is used to mean a UNIX or UNIX-like system that has
certain core utilities, *not* the kernel itself or something highly technical
like that).

Learning the basics of *some* editor is probably a good idea. Editors like `vi`
and `nano` can be found pretty much anywhere. It probably won't be too difficult
for you to grab a more sophisticated editor like `vim`, `emacs` or even `VSCode`
if that is your cup of tea.

## Exploring your filesystem

Are there things that you don't understand? How do you find documentation for
those things?
