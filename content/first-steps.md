title: Getting Comfortable with Linux

This tutorial aims to answer this question:

**Now that I have a Linux system running, how do I go about learning
more?**

This tutorial is aimed at eager beginners and aspiring computer users
that have decided to take control of their computing. It largely
follows my journey to learn more about Linux specifically and
computing more generally. My goal is that with this tutorial and a
handful of things downloaded, you can sit with your
computer&mdash;even without an Internet connection and learn more
about computing.

My approach here is thematic; I go over some class of actions you
might want to do, and then mention some options you may choose to
succeed at doing these things.

Requirements
------------

In this tutorial, I assume that you have a Linux system up and running
(...and here, the term "Linux" is used to mean a UNIX or UNIX-like
system that has certain core utilities, *not* the kernel itself or
something highly technical like that). For something that just works,
[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) and [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/)
are some solid options. If you want to spend some more time
configuring things, you may want to try [installing Arch
Linux](https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/). Really, it
doesn't matter that much where you start because you are entering
Linux land where customizability is king.

### Editors

What is a samurai without a sword? You need an editor! Most things on
Linux are configurable via a **"dot file"**, so called because they
have a name that starts with a *dot* (e.g. `.bashrc`,
`.eslint`...). You will need an editor to change these files. If you
are enthusiastic about learning Linux, you probably have some interest
in writing scripts or programs or some sort. You'll need an editor for
that too.

Learning the basics of some editor is a skill you will not
regret. Editors like `vi` and `nano` can be found pretty much
anywhere. It probably won't be too difficult for you to grab a more
sophisticated editor like `vim`, `emacs`, or Visual Studio Code.

The GUI way
-----------

There is a big movement to make Linux systems intuitive and
"user-friendly", particularly for users coming from Windows and
Mac. No explanations needed here&mdash;you can explore the menus and
built in softwares with any Linux distribution that comes built in
with a graphical desktop environment. 

There is no shame in using and enjoying a GUI. For many things, this
is the easiest way to get things done, particularly if you don't care
to do any special configuration. Examples of things I've recently used
GUI menus to configure:

- Themes/fonts
- Wallpaper
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Joining wifi networks
- Sound/volume stuff

Other tasks, such as managing software, is perhaps better done through
the Command Line Interface (CLI).

Whispering into the soul of your system
---------------------------------------

Lots of things on modern computers are "artifacts of engineering",
leftover remnants from designs of the past. One interesting example is
the "command line interface" typically accessed through a **terminal**
(emulator).

Computers used to look like this:

In more current times, the old way of interacting with computers is
emulated using what is usually called something like "terminal" or
"shell" on modern systems.

### Need moar software

Most Linux distributions ship with a **package manager**. 

### Exploring your filesystem

Typing stuff like `ls -la` all the time can get very tiring. One way
to get around this problem is to define **aliases** for commands you
commonly use.

Another way to get around your file sytem is to use a **file manager**
that runs on the command line (or within your favorite editor). For
example, there is [`vifm`](https://vifm.info/) for doing common
operations like moving, copying, and renaming files in a vim editor
like way. Emacs has the built in
[`dired`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html)
mode to do these things.

### Getting system info

To find out some quick information about your system and display it in
a pretty way, use your package manager to download and install
`screenfetch`. There are of course other places to find all of this
information, but this is the easiest way to getting system info (that
also looks cool) akin to doing the "about my computer" stuff on
Windows or MacOS.


Finding more information
------------------------

Are there things that you don't understand? How do you find
documentation for those things?

### Clicking through menus

This is often how I learn more about the features of some program. You
may discover useful commands you never thought you needed if you take
the time to click through some menus.

I've found this especially helpful in using widely used, large,
complex programs like GIMP (image manipulation) and Blender (3D
graphics).

### Built-in help systems

Many pieces of software come with their own built in help
systems. Many (most?) users jump to searching the Internet for
answers, but becoming familiar with the built-in help system for some
software may be able to provide quicker, more specific answers if you
invest a little bit of time to learn how to use it.

Documentation is often available for download for offline viewing. If
you have a 12 hour flight coming up, why not read a user manual until
you fall asleep? (either way, you win&mdash;you learn something or you
get a good rest).

### High quality online resources

Not all websites are created equal; finding the best websites can save
you a lot of time you'd otherwise spend sifting through crap.

Rather than na√Øvely Googling how to do something on Linux, for
instance, it may be helpful to first consult the [Arch
Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) for Linux related topics. This
resource can be useful even for non-Arch users that want to learn
about some topic and Linux. For instance, recently I wanted to see
what options were available for [ripping
CDs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Optical_disc_drive#Ripping). The
Arch Wiki had lots of helpful information for doing that on my
(non-Arch) Debian-based system.
