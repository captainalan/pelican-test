In California, I hear we have some additional guidelines about wearing
masks and social distancing and all that.

A bunch of stuff broke earlier, so I had to go out on some errands. It
seems that stores (which I imagine are under close(er) scrutiny) are
by-in-large making visible efforts to comply with whatever guidelines
they need to in order to continue business.

The population at large will when they have to&mdash;for example, many
stores won't allow people inside unless they have proper masks and
things. Stuff that is less easy to manage is... how do you get people
to stay 6+ feet apart when they have to pass one another in relatively
narrow store aisles?

I'll be heading up to the mountains in not too long for the weekend;
seems like they will be pretty people-filled. Many people have the
same idea&mdash;head to higher ground and chill out.
