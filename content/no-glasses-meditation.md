I'm going to try something for some time. Every day, I will spend a
chunk of time (maybe 2 hours) without my glasses.  The idea is to
train concentration, memory, recall and using other senses.

As a side effect, I hope to also train myself to spend more time doing
mind-work while on my feet, doing chores, etc.

### Reading too much is a problem
 
It is easy to become passive simply **consooming** information; in the
age of the Internet, there is endless verbiage to consume. Without
deliberate filtering, you are at the mercy of editorial boards (or
lack thereof). Each person must become their own bureau of
censorship/education.

By not wearing glasses, for some time each day, I hope to become more
deliberate in whatever I do.
