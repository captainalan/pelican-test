Looking at the what is going on around me, I think I can predict at
least one more year of a "lock-down" like situation. [^1] Each of us
should ask, *how should I spend that time?*

This could mean considering rather big lifestyle changes. For
instance, if you are a single, working person in a big city who is
barely saving any money through working, perhaps it is time to
re-assess the situation and decide *is this arrangement worth it?* The
answer you come up with may be something like *yes, but I need to
spend less* or even *I need to move back to XYZ less expensive
option*. Regardless of where each of us are, we can determine *what
degrees of freedomS we do have* and carefully consider how to exercise
our autonomy.

Securing the Means to Work
--------------------------

Highly "institutionally coupled" types of work&mdash;e.g. skills in a
particular piece of proprietary, corporate software&mdash;may not as
readily transferable to another domain. Similarly, some jobs are very
highly bound up with the current political/financial/etc institutions.
Is an expert on tax codes this year and expert on tax codes 3 years
from now?

Similar examples of highly specialized types of work that may not be
readily transferrable if the occasion calls include,

- specialization with a particular type of machine you do not own (e.g
  servicing a particular sort of airplane)
- programing of various sorts&mdash;e.g. being an expert in some 3D
  gaming C++ library thing
- Specialized cooking, baking, etc that relies on not readily
  available ingredients

This isn't to say that you *shouldn't invest in domain specific
knowledge*; rather, I'm making a reminder to myself that in addition
to becoming skilled with whatever tools you are required to work with
for a particular job, one *should not lose sight of time management,
more broadly*. You do not want to "put all your eggs in one basket" if
that basket can easily be taken away from you.

It is a good idea overall to find ways in which we can do work that
are more **robust** to the winds of what is going on. Ways to do this
may include,
 
- Owning high quality tools that can be used to do work, or may be
  (re)sold without much difficulty
- Maintaining networks of trustworthy friends
- Working on physical fitness
- Memorizing useful information (e.g. foreign languages)
- Learning general techniques to exploit readily available
  tools&mdash;being able to draw useful diagrams and organize data
  into charts can just as readily be done with a pen and paper as it
  can on a newer technology like Microsoft Excel and Google Docs [^2]
- Maintaining some kind of log (e.g. this blog) of how you are working
  through problems

The written log thing is also a useful way to keep you on track and
motivated to continue working through stuff. With accountability to
yourself (and an audience, if you happen to have one) you can more
easily push yourself to keep on working even if you may feel lazy or
unmotivated one day. Routine is very important for making steady
progress.


[^1]: Look up Klaus Schwab, the *Fourth Industrial Revolution*, and
    *The Great Reset* for more information about the general
    trajectory we can see certain parties *try* to push. See
    [Computing Forever]'s [How is This a Thing? 11th of November
    2020](https://www.bitchute.com/video/33rlMWNJKNE/).
[^2]: Another related technique is to *learn to use basic features
    well* while avoiding specialized, "cutting edge" features. For
    example, if MS Excel can do some one fancy thing, but Google Docs
    cannot, it may be helpful to avoid using this particular feature
    and see if you can design a solution around making use of basic
    functions which are common to both.
