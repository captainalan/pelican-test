Today I continue off yesterday's notes on *In the Buddha's Words: An
Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon*, which I take to be
representative of Theravada Buddhism. [^1]

Karma and Suffering
-------------------

It seems in Buddhism, suffering in the world is not totally chaotic or
random. This can be interpreted in a very "anti-social justice" sense
in that when we see bad things happen to people, there is an
underlying belief that *their karma made them deserve this*.

Now, the Buddhist will want to escape suffering (and probably help
others do the same, cultivating *loving-kindness*). But viewing
suffering in the world is also seeing the *results* of suffering
perpetuating behaviors.

The typical Christian world-view on these things is much different.
Similarly, Christians don't believe in repeating cycles of death and
rebirth. [^2]
