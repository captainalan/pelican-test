Today's topic is *accountability as motivation*. Specifically, I'll be
looking at how the tough-times of COVID-19 lock-in have weakened many
(usually present) accountability mechanisms that keep most of us
going. Then, I'll go into some strategies I've successfully used to
keep myself going. My goal is to share some info I have found useful
and also to remind myself of things that have worked for me.

*Let the psychologizing and rationalization begin!*

Accountability: "Nagging" You Ask For
-------------------------------------

Accountability is kinda like... *nagging you ask for*. That is, you
ask someone, some party, or some computer program to bring something
to your attention (such that you can use this information to make
better choices). In the moment, you may not *want* to hear those
reminders, but you set up a system such that your past-self can help
your present-self make good choices for your future-self.

For instance, family members may agree to hold themselves accountable
for *doing meal preparation at the beginning of the week* in order to
try to eat more whole foods and save money from not eating
out. Accountability means reminding the people involved to keep a
schedule, repeating reasons why such-and-such is a good idea, and of
course each individual agreeing to do what they said they would
do. More proactive accountability may include facilitating success in
the project by doing appropriate shopping, finding
inspirational/informative videos etc.

### Lock-in Challenges

As explored in [Part 8](./corona-virus-008.html) of this series, many
structured aspects of our "daily routines" are disturbed by this
lock-down business. Activities taken for granted like *commuting to
work/school* are disturbed. Also interrupted are things like
*physical accountability of seeing familiar faces in classrooms and
workplaces*.

Many interrupted activities were important for
accountability&mdash;rather than "raw data transfer". For instance,
you don't really "learn anything" about Calculus from the first five
or ten minutes or so of settling in class. However, this time is
important for many students to figure out "was I the only one confused
about question XYZ?" or "who here knows what is going on".

Technologies like Zoom (video conferencing) impose different, often
more limited
[channels](https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/essays/channels.html)
of communication on people in workplaces, students, etc. While these
channels are often adequate to convey the "primary" material of
lecture content, meeting agendas, and so forth, they are often much
poorer at encouraging accountability.  Furthermore, in these
channels, inequalities of access are magnified by students'
differences in computer hardware, technical know-how, and connection
speeds [^1].

### Accountability as a Service

One strategy I've found helpful to stay motivated is to appreciate and
use *accountability as a service*.

Locked-down times have reminded me that much of the value of
institutions of things like schools and offices is the *structure of
accountability* it delivers, rather than the "knowledge" you get
there. Places where people gather are engines of social accountability
to keep people moving (and hopefully, learning).

Currently, one position I am working is as a teaching assistant at a
web programing bootcamp. One of the main functions of this bootcamp is
to help give students *structure in order to learn*. Truly, you can
find all the content of the bootcamp for free online; this is open
source software stuff that you can learn about without paying a cent
using public library Internet. However, in addition to raw technical
know-how, bootcamp offers structure and accountability *as a service*.

Understanding my role as offering accountability as a service means
that I can redouble efforts towards broader common goals, rather that
over-optimizing specialist knowledge for narrow technical domains.
Leaving class with students feeling empowered and prepared to read
documenation and follow XYZ steps to solve some problem is a bigger
accomplishment than solving some problems *for* a few students and
having them leave class thinking "wow this is so complicated" or "alan
knows a lot of stuff".

My business-book instincts tell me that this sort of idea is
"leadership"; you want to offer vision and motivation to other people
to move forward so you don't have to do everything yourself. Of
course, there are many steps you must take to gain the trust of those
working with you, but ultimately, success is in having independent
actors working at solving problems you haven't even thought of yet.

Competition and Care
--------------------

A bit of a topic jump here&mdash;

There is another type of accountability which we are mostly all
familiar with in some domain or another: **competition**.

Competition is very important because it means that you know at least
*someone* cares about what you are doing&mdash;namely your rivals.

As people transition out of schooling, where there are things like
sports/grades/exams/popularity to have competitions with, the metrics
of competition become much more harder to discern.

One challenge I faced while being a graduate student was not really
having much competition in that I was focused on pretty esoteric
topics and didn't particularly need to "beat" anyone at anything
(maybe write a grant proposal that means some person subjectively
likes such and such better?). The accountability/motivation structure
of competition just wasn't there for me because I didn't really see a
point of me wanting to become "the best" in my field. Graduate school
grades don't work the same way as like... undergraduate math class.
I found myself enjoying taking undergraduate math classes because I
needed some quantitative validation. Trading stocks and bitcoin also
gave me some metrics to "compete" on.

### Re-introducing competition into your life

A strategy I see for maintaining motivation during COVID-19 is to
ask *how much competition do I like to have?* Then, if you do not have
enough competition, you should find some people to create some sort of
game/accountability with.

For instance:

- Find a friend that shares a hobby; make a challenge to improve
  (e.g. memorize such and such Chopin piano piece; have a duel in 2
  weeks)
- Climb your workplace power ladder; volunteer to take up some
  responsibility you have not had before, and take charge
- Make a fixed plan for something you are trying to improve on:bucks
  e.g. fitness goals, writing more, etc.; make it fun by agreeing to
  give someone 100 dollars or something if you mess up on some
  pre-defined terms

I think that people differ in terms of personality on how much
competition they like. Many people are pretty darn comfy with
virtually zero competiton, and that's fine.  Growing up, I was
"anti-competitive" in many ways: for instance, I enjoyed learning to
juggle and having fun with some circus skills rather than succeeding
in more mainstream sports [^2]. Breaking out of this bubble after a
while though, I found that I really enjoyed competition especially
because it meant having more people to share experiences with.

Conclusions
-----------

Accountability is a powerful force. On one hand, *establishing*
accountability is a powerful act of *self determination* in which we
actively make plans for how we are going to live our lives better. On
the other hand, accountability is a contract in accepting controlled
unpleasantness (nagging, delaying gratification).  Accountability is
making plans of action to use the people, institutions, machines,
etc. around us *conspire* for our success.

When we don't have accountability in our lives (either to ourselves or
to others), we may experience more unpleasantness in more unexpected
ways than we would like. 

Creating structures of accountability means making us motivated to
answer not just to ourselves, but also to the people around us. In
doing so, stuff becomes more fun and interesting and the not-so-fun
moments we experience are at least directly contributing towards some
productive end. This is the stuff living is made of.

[^1]: Alas, I too can re-iterate leftist talking points!
[^2]: Why? I think part of this was the fact that I could get some
      attention and stuff for just being "different" and enjoying
      something intrinsically kinda fun rather than diving into the
      bigger institutional opportunities available to me.
