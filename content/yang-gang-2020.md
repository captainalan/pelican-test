title: Yang Gang 2020 Aftermath

Andrew Yang stopped his campaign some time around today. I was not
necessarily opposed to Yang, but was by no means an ardent supporter
either. Here's I share some thoughts about Yang's political
messages/campaign.

First are some impressions/observations:

- Yang campaigned hard on **Universal Basic Income**, $1000 bucks a
  month for pretty much all adults in a certain age range
    - I accept Yang's point that this is probably a better
      redistribution scheme than other existing programs, layers and
      layers of bureaucracy, etc.
    - I would not like to see the government expand; it is unclear to
      me if Yang's Freedom Divident (aka **NEET bux**) would be
      accompanied by cutting government spending elsewhere
    - If UBI were to come to be, I'd expect a proliferation of
      subsisting people living ant-style (*ari-zoku*) for free; talk
      about danger for epidemics! A specialized class of rent-farmers
      would likely thrive too... (speculation)
- Yang's race/ethnicity is a whatever to me
    - But I see you racialists out there choosing Yang just because
      he's "of color" or "Asian" just like people chose Obama for
      similar reasons
    - I think that there are both people more inclined to vote for
      Yang *because* he's Asian, and also people who would choose not
      to because of that... ...or maybe it's more about him appealing
      to the "nerd" demographic
- Talk of the threat of Artificial Intelligence and climate change
  without talk about populations/demographics gets the noggin' joggin'
    - Should governments decide which groups to subsidize (and
      hence increase) at the expense of others?
    - (Insert Leftist critiques of big oil, tobacco industries, and
      related topics)
	  
Yang appears to me to be a pretty good guy, and a sincere person. In
this way, I think he has a trustworthy "feel" like Sanders. However, I
do believe his policies in general would drive America to be worse and
worse; sorry Ayn Rand brainwashed me.
	  
## Dichotomous Political Opinions

From the **right**, I like how Yang

1. criticizes the inefficiency of government
2. has a scheme to allow capitalism, but with some safety net
    - see how people relate UBI to "classical liberal" thought
3. rouses **swamp-drainy** thoughts and criticisms of the **legacy
   media** on the Dem side (search term **yang media blackout**)

From the **left**, I like how Yang

1. Has a redistributionist scheme that *is more universal than
   anything we've seen before*
2. Seems relatively peaceful, not war-hawky


## Open the Third Eye; Optics and Meta-Cognitive Stuff 

I dislike the 'MATH' campaign thing and all that nerd stuff; I see
that Yang is a lawyer too, not an engineer or even a veteran
(C.f. Tulsi Gabbard) so I suspect how "in touch" with reality he is on
the physics of the world. Math is wallowing in abstractions; how does
this map to reality?

This doesn't matter to most people who just clamour against "CLIMATE
CHANGE" and view they have "SCIENCE" on their side without
understanding a thing about it, besides what they've heard, akin to
how most people accept the traditions/religions handed to them.
(**Note**: I'm not denying climate change or criticizing
traditions/religions here, I'm just making a point about how people
accept/reject ideas presented to them...)

## The memes were with him...

(...but many were probably by top-down design)


In any case, I hope that this whole Yang ordeal encoruages people to
criticially evaluate the sources they get any information from.

In this blog post, I cite nothing and just say my impressions. No fake
news here. Just opinions. Is your news just opinions too?
