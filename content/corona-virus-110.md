It is very politically correct to frame any trouble in terms of "the pandemic".
To talk about **coping**, days "blurring together" (forced meme
"[**blursday**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blursday)"),
and how pharmaceuticals and other products of "the machine" can help us "just
get by". [^1] It is almost as if everyone is being *encouraged* to embrace the
idea that they are traumatized and then to trust state-sanctioned solutions to
solve their problems.

The "mainstream narrative" pushed in one form or another by all major media
outlets is one of surrendering agency and capitulating to a kind of gnostic
worldview in which reality is cruel and impersonal, and only throught he
mediation of a kind of "**Scientist/expert**" priest class can we hope to make
progress. You are allowed to think how "trippy" quantum physics is and marvel
at the latest cosmology "discoveries". [^2] Certain parties will be more than
happy to sell you various products aid you in *forgetting* what has been done or
to *distract yourself* from what is going around you.

Consider some slogans going on,

- "trust the experts"&mdash;let the establishment make decisions for you; don't
  question the narrative
- "build back better"&mdash;note the "666" in *6uild 6ack 6etter*; people in
  power tore down the "old order" and are now trying to market a
  "**sustainable/green** future of increased surveillance, more restricted
  freedoms, and living arrangements that make us more tightly bound to
  governments and major corporations. 
- "stop XYZ"&mdash;regardless of what XYZ is, "activism" of this sort often
  amounts to *doing nothing*. Giving people the illusion of being influential
  by joining in official outrage sessions provides a cathartic release in a
  controlled setting from the perspective of administrators

Note that the people pushing all of these things have massive budgets *and*
platform control. So while it may seem like "everyone is talking about
such-and-such", we see how social media platforms, bill boards, and signs
around the city, and other places where people advertise are monopolized by the
same parties with the same sorts of funding sources pushing the same sorts of
narratives.

Here, I'm not just calling "fake news" on everything&mdash;I will in fact cite
many major media outlets themselves reporting on who they are and who funds
them:

- ["Big Media Companies And Their Many Brands &mdash; In One
  Chart"](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/10/28/499495517/big-media-companies-and-their-many-brands-in-one-chart)
  (2016) by NPR.
- [Corporation for Public Broadcasting](https://www.cpb.org/) &mdash; "A
  Private Corporation Funded by the American People"; while news outlets like
  NPR or the BBC in the UK may sound "neutral" in that you might presume that
  these organizations are just "working in the public's interest", closer
  examination reveals they are just as "for profit" as other companies, only
  they have a different model for getting revenue and project a different image
  to the public.

Big money and big government are behind both "private" and "public" media, and
they are work together to push the same sorts of narratives. **Big Tech** has
emerged over the past couple decades as a partner in crime. Look up how these
various big players buy up or assimilate smaller companies/organizations to see
how the octopus spreads its tentacles.

## "Main Street" vs Wall Street

So does everything suck? Of course not. The establishment players I'm talking
about are are bank-rolled by coercion (taxes you don't really have a choice
about paying or not; big corporations can weaponize laws/lawyers like smaller
players can't). They are nearly everywhere and continue spreading their influence.

- ["The real reason why Bill Gates is now the US' biggest farmland
  owner"](https://nypost.com/2021/02/27/why-bill-gates-is-now-the-us-biggest-farmland-owner/)
  (New York Post, 02/27/2021)&mdash;meanwhile, "normal people" struggle to own
  any land at all
- 5G pushed on you; you didn't have to ask for it
- Electric/self-driving cars means surrendering your autonomy; where does
  electricity come from? Does manufacturing this stuff cause a lot of
  pollution? A quick investigation will reveal that the "green revolution"
  probably does more harm than good for the earth.
- Proliferation of **veganism** and plant-based ultra-processed foods; just
  look around town, you'll see all of this stuff

There is a multi-front push for consolidation of control by some very powerful
people. Most people aren't "in" on some giant conspiracy&mdash;we all need
money to feed ourselves and/or our families. That being said, you only need *a
few villanious actors* and then a lot of people who will just "go along with
the program" to pull off schemes of evil design.

So don't go bully your local bank teller&mdash;that won't help anything. Do,
however, choose to spend money on "main street" (i.e. small, medium-sized
normal people businesses) and avoid giving control to the power hungry badguys
when you can!

## Outrage

Events to express **outrage** over are being fed to shotgun style to the
population. If the race-baiting communists of BLM don't "get you", then maybe
talk targetting *your* demographic will be more moving (e.g. Anti-Asian crimes;
talk about the Mexican border). A one-size fits all fear-mongering scheme is to
talk about more regulations for firearms&mdash;more careful discussions about
what sorts of weapons people use to commit crimes (illegally acquired) and

Participating in state-sanctioned outrage doesn't help anything; it keeps your
hands tied and makes you passion-driven and ineffective. Power hungry people
would like you to be trapped in a rage-cycle because then you are
tamed&mdash;it is like playing with a cat with a laser pointer. Only the laser
dot is stories given to you by the news and the cat is your attention. 

## Independent Voices

Rather than naively trusting the big boys' news narratives, getting the
perspectives of people "on the ground" gives a fuller picture of what is going
on. This isn't a "Democrat vs Republican" or even "Right vs Left"
issue&mdash;transcend the **dialectic**.

Here's some people I've watched lately (these are not overtly political or
religious channels; useful information for anyone interested):

- [Coffeezilla](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFQMnBA3CS502aghlcr0_aw)&mdash;especially
  valuable for his work uncovering scams/pyramid schemes
- [ThisIsJohnWilliams](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwi9Hu0rE5eblY4NiyTyX1A)
  real estate investor formerly based in California who discusses many finance
  related topics, including current events/taxation/etc
- [Academic
  Agent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyawG3aTE7RmNQcFQskDWcw)&mdash;based
  British guy who discusses topics like pop culture and economics
- [Mental
  Outlaw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7YOGHUfC1Tb6E4pudI9STA)&mdash;lots
  of tech and corporate topics as well as practical info on DYI computing

In this day and age where it is increasingly difficult to find more
"independent" takes via search engines (including Google, "the Youtube
Algorithm), sharing/spreading links *the old fashioned way* is often the best
way to be *ackshually* informed, I think.
