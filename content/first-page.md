Coders go to sleep late. They can also edit pages later that don't
have very much text. This page was edited and more text was
added. Wow! 

Does code highlighting work here?

```javascript
// ES5
function foo() {
  console.log("bar baz");
}

// ES6+
const blah = () => {
  let a = [1,2,3];
  return = a.map(x => x + 1);
}

```
