This morning I got the pleasant surprise of a new video in Luke
Smith's *Not Related* podcast series&mdash;["Against Method and For
'Pseudoscience'"](https://www.bitchute.com/video/hVxvLd6cF0k/). Once
again, Luke *Senpai* was a year or so ahead of my investigations into
various issues related to linguistics, history of science, and the
like etc. It is very nice to see some ideas I just started fumbling
around with presented in a such an accessible way to a wide audience.

I was thinking of publishing some more autobiographical/narrative
stuff here, but had misgivings midway through writing and ended up
deleting what I had written. Maybe I'll think over and write some
stuff on these topics I was thinking of later.

In many ways, the Internet has gotten more convenient and nice. For
instance, we have more than a dozen chat services to choose from to
exchange text messages, photos, etc. With this, however, the Internet
also feels much more corporate. It seems less fun, less free, and *far
more political*.

...and so, writing this blog I wonder; what is the point of me trying
to just shoot-the-shit here? It may de-favor me in search engines and
stuff if I would like my work to get more popular. Furthermore, anything
remotely controversial I may write could be used against me.

Here, being "a nobody" is helpful in that there is nothing dramatic
happening/going on with my blog. It is just an open journal that I find
useful to write in because it helps me look from a third person
perspective on the stuff I think and say and see if it makes any sense
(and if it is worth sharing).

As we're getting into the night, I'm too tired to do any "serious
studying" or reading now... I'll probably go to sleep soon. The agenda
of this journal is to think out loud, to figure out what is going on.
It is Friday night in Sacramento, CA and I'm not really talking to
anybody right now. There is a curfew outside, so I can't go for a
literal walk outside. So, I go for a little metaphorical walk writing
stuff here... turning sentence-thoughts into prose from a standing
work station made of furniture and books and old computer parts.
