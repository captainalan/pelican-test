Over the past decade or so with the rise of big tech and social media,
we're seeing arbitrary standard being put into place about what we can
and cannot say. I will not belabor the point of tech censorship, but
instead I will focus on how groups in power are allowed to talk about
whatever they want while simultaneously silencing other groups under
the pretense of terms like "hate speech". This essay is about how
certain groups are allowed to talk about politics as much as they want
while shutting down opposition. [^0]

Note that I haven't looked at the Trump executive media
this-or-that&mdash;my [**political
efficacy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_efficacy) is
pretty low, so I tend to be pretty stoic about political matters. [^1]
I will not discuss the specifics of some law/policy.

What follows is thus... just an analysis. I'm not trying to win your
vote or anything nor do I demand you to participate in some revolution
or change your Facebook profile picture.

It's okay to talk about XYZ, as long as you agree with me
---------------------------------------------------------

In the mainstream media (including social media, where this content is
often aggregated), we see ample "discussions" of all of the following
things:

- race
- gender
- social classes
- geopolitics (e.g. Hong Kong action; bad guy China)


All of these things are discussed openly, but certain positions are
not allowed to be articulated. This is the 1984/fake
news/etc. "matrix" of *controlled opposition*. You are free to move
about in the same way as a train on tracks.

For instance, you can say Latinx female and non-binary individuals are
the target of oppression by you-know-who, so we need to allow for XYZ
in the name of human rights. However, if you were to create an exposé
on Latino (or some other Officially Oppressed ™ group) on East Asian
violence, you would probably get chased off social media by angry
mobs, unless all your friends happen to be Nazis. They would tell
*you* that you-know-who just wants to divide **People of Color ™** to
keep them oppressed.
	
You may be forgiven if you say that you mis-spoke and that what you
*really* meant was that XYZ aliens in such and such fictional universe
have legitimate greviances against ABC aliens.  Talking about
"nerd/geek" stuff like... the Marvel universe or Harry Potter or
something, you can see how all sorts of *ideas* can be
discussed&mdash;but only in fictional worlds and the abstract.  It is
okay to talk about politics as long as you fall into line with current
political actors.

The main point here is that there are certain narratives&mdash;which
may be *very political* in the sense that they're about how force is
used to change how people interact with another&mdash;which are
perfectly okay to talk about at the dinner tables of many "nice
people". They have no problem with you talking about politics as long
as you agree with them. What there is a problem with is *disagreement*
or lack of obedience&mdash;e.g. refusal to regurgitate *talking
points*.

And so, mantras of social alignment are repeated so that people can
signal which groups they belong to.

### So are you telling me that group XYZ are actually in power?

Yes, and no... You can imagine how different groups can win/lose the
favor of a ruling elite. For instance, the US government may prop up
Taiwan's KMT party one day and then later decide that they are corrupt
and "anti-democracy" and switch support to another group.

I haven't read much about what has been going on with ISIS and Syria
and all that, but I imagine studying that region or Latin America
would give some historical backing to the above claim.

What I'm saying is that if you have a strong opinion about some
situation, e.g. the following issues,

- Free Tibet
- Free Hong Kong
- Cuban communism is not even that bad
- Russia wants the worse for the US
- Japan needs more immigration because of an aging population
- Catholicism needs to reform for the 21st century
- Christianity needs to "return to its fundamentals"
- Islam is "a religion of peace" (conversely, "Islam is the worst
  thing that has happened to the world since electric (non-gas)
  stoves")

...you may have been pressured by all sorts of top-down planning to
arrive at your conclusion. That's *okay*, but I urge you to consider
again hopping onto some political movement so as to not become
somebody else's "useful idiot".

It is fine to just say "I don't know enough about XYZ to form an
opinion" or even "I don't think the government should legislate on
ABC". When the time comes to have "skin in the game" and vote with our
feet/dollars, people *will make political decisions*. 

### Our tech overlords, tagged data sets

Our silicon valley tech-utopian overlords would like us to tag and
label ourselves in all sorts of ways. This is how "machine learning"
and "big data" works. People create data by expressing choices among a
small set of discrete options.

Once you come up with some "classification task", you can sort
desirable versus undesirable thinking. [^2]

Note that voting and democracy often works in a similar way. What we
are getting is a kind of automatic voting through opinion expressing
for our technocratic oligarchs to push their transhumanist ideals
incrementally on the unsuspecting consoomer masses.


Hiding in my text editor
------------------------

The past month or so, I've largely turned to arcane technical things
for personal development, entertainment, and network formation. [^2]
Even talking about stuff like popular entertainment can get pretty
political pretty fast as talk about such-and-such discrimination
here-and-there and under/over representation this-and-that is often
the analysis of professional opinion-expressers. [^3]

At a certain point, *many people don't want to be political*&mdash;by
this I mean, we want to just go about our days *not* talking about how
groups leverage government (force) to accomplish their end-goals.
There are other things to use language for such as: displaying
affection towards one another, composing music and poetry, solving
difficult technical problems, learning the names of things
(e.g. muscle groups for sports training or drawing anime)

What I present here is thus a rant about how normal people get nudged
into pushing politics to everything and how *we have a choice to be
less political* by actively recognizing the double-standards applied
to "political speech" of all sorts.

Most of the time I don't talk about politics... but when I do, I'd
rather hear most people reason abstractly about Starwars (omg light
side vs dark side) than talk about some not-so-well understood "facts"
reported from halfway across the globe.


[^0]: You know who is in power by what you aren't allowed to say.
[^1]: Muh politics lean libertarian (not too far from *liberal*) which
    means I want minimally state intervention. I am *not* a globalist
    in that I think we should have different nations pursuing
    different policies and that we can't expect "free trade" and stuff
    like that from political actors (states) playing by waaaay
    different rules.

    that platform.](https://streamable.com/8frppe)

    Politics out of
    Technology!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NJIj47Tusw) by Luke
    Smith, Our Prophet of Non-Bloat.
[^4]: Other "normal" interests like cooking, playing music, etc. are
    great too. If you choose a rather obscure interest (e.g. some old
    programing language) you may be more likely to meet people who
    have explored similar ideas to you or have similar personalities
