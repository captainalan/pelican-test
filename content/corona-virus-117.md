Ice Age Farmer put out [a
video](https://www.iceagefarmer.com/2021/04/06/absolute-slavery-zero-carbon-agenda-deconstructed/)
video in which he pointed out a common pattern for introducing global
changes. Start with some grand narrative, e.g. *climate change due to
carbon emissions*. Then, take some terrible exemplar of what something
current looks like&mdash;e.g. a factory farm. Next, beat this
easy-to-hate **strawman** as a representative with some entire
position&mdash;in this example *people should be free to consume
meat*. Furthermore, no explanation is given for how the current
situation arose. Why is meat production so centralized these days to
begin with?

Narratives like the one above pull on the emotional strings of people
based on a truth&mdash;factory farms look nasty. But then, this image
is tied with things that are not so directly related to it. Does
sustaining human populations *demand* farming as we currently have it?

Going in the other direction, we can see how all sorts of things get
attached to labels like **"education"** and **"science"**. Getting
smeared as being "against education" or "against science" emotionally
manipulates people based ont he *positive* associations of these
terms.
