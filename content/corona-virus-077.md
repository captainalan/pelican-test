Many things are "still going", but around me I can many *traditions*
getting knocked away one after another. [^1]
Here are a handful of things in no particular order:

- shopping malls
- professional sports
- cafes, coffee shops
- public school, including "school traditions"
- holidays
- "work/home balance"

Growing up, these things were still pretty much in place in a
comparable state to what my parents' generation had. News things like
*the Internet* came up, but still the Internet was being used to
augment/add upon existing infrastructure, not wholesale replacing it.

I would say that the arrival and popularization of *the smartphone*
was a kind of "societal inflection point" for how many things are
done.

[^1]: Much of "American Culture" (or *global culture*) is pretty new
    creation&mdash;developed over the past 200 years or so
