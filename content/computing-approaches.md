title: Approaches to computing

Using mobile devices and tablets, there is often only one way really
to do things. The same goes for the interfaces of many video
games. There is a single way to do things like change settings,
enter/exit the application, etc.

The same *cannot* be said for many desktop/laptop computers. For
instance, to install programs on MS Windows or Mac OS, many users just
(manually) go download some installer file and install things. Other
users will make use of Microsoft/Apple's official stores to get their
apps. Finally, some users (usually programmers, developers) make use of 
**package managers** to do this job.

The different paths a user may take to do something like "install a
program" represent different approaches to computing, generally. For
instance, we might use some words to embody the three approaches for
installing listed above as:

1. "Lemme get what I need to do"
2. "Make it easy and make it feel official, please"
3. "Tedious things should be automated"

## What I do these days

After hours, I boot up Linux (see my [Arch Linux install
guide](https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html)),
launch emacs (see my [config
file](https://gist.github.com/captainalan/d2d94f8ff88ba0c74e85560246d51fdf),
and proceed to write code, prose, and everything in between.
