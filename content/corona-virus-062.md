Computers (laptops, desktops) and smartphones are all **tools** which
can potentially be useful to us. Like a chainsaw, however, they can
also be dangerous. Reckless play with these things

Too fast, too slow
------------------

The computer I'm presently writing from isn't a particularly fast
computer. Using "modern" apps (e.g. web browsers, Discord) I have
crashed this computer many times. But if I stick to dinosaur-style
software usage (e.g. my text editor, browser without many tabs open),
then I'm fine.

However, for getting writing done, this is a very "fast" computer. I
use it as a digital typewriter/publishing machine as well as an
occasional dictionary.

If I were still a student and had a writing homework assignment, I
wouldn't hesitate to hop onto this computer to get stuff done. Trying
to get writing done on a super fast gaming rig with all sorts of fun
games and distracting apps would not be very conducive to hammering
out some prose.

Identify the task at hand
-------------------------

Rather than just hanging out with a computer, I've found that it is
helpful to first take a moment or so to *remember why I am* going on
the computer in the first place. The answer to this question could be
*to socialize* or *to play games*&mdash;what is important is that *you
recognize your intentions with using your tools (computer, phone,
etc.)* such that a few hours pass and regret how you spent your time.

With a computer, one can do many things:

### Rest/Play

- Chat with friends, maintain networks/communications
- Play video games
- Experiment with software
- Make memes

### Work

- Study a foreign language
- Read/annotate a book
- Write programs to get work done
- Organize files
- Compile research into shareable writings
- Do system maintenance
- Data entry
- Data processing, analysis (e.g. doing something useful with a
  spreadsheet)
- Keeping a log/diary

As you can see, there are many things you can do with a computer that
would likely be more difficult to do with only a pen/paper. Especially
when it comes to sharing the work you have done, digital information
technology is very useful.

Distractions
------------

Computers *should not* be used as a distraction/coping mechanism. Are
you logging on the computer *to distract yourself from doing XYZ
chores?* It may be time to shut up, get up, and do the work that is in
front of you rather than **derping** around on the Internet.

Similarly, if you are getting caught up in some Internet
argument&mdash;you can ask yourself&mdash;"to what end am I doing
this?" If the answer to this question is to *stroke your ego (by
showing the world how smart you are)*, or to make somebody feel bad...
...well you should probably go do something else.

Not a "Luddite"
---------------

I'm not an advocate of just trashing all the technology and returning
to being a "caveman". However, I also think that we shouldn't
uncritically embrace new technology as "progress". 

We're all living in a particular time and place&mdash;it is up to each
of us to choose to use what we've been given wisely.
