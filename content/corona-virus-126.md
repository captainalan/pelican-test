What is "10 minutes"? If you're running late for something, it may be
all someone needs to feel relief; if you're doing a workout, it may
feel like prolonged torture. When we are at rest, it is easy to look
at time abstractly&mdash;e.g. I can play to study something for *15
minutes a day*. Actually blocking out the time and setting down to do
that thing makes time seem much more... personal.

To get the most out of our time, it is important to carefully use it
(which could mean getting someone else to help make a schedule),
otherwise it easily can "slip through the cracks". Retroactively,
anybody would probably say, "oh yeah I wish I did 20 minutes of
[productive thing] everyday" (for example, lifting some weights to get
stronger). Why doesn't this happen?
