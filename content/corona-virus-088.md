title: Corona Virus Diary, Part 88

How can writing a blog like this be useful? This log has become a kind
of diary, but it also reflects *how* I think (or have thought) about
stuff. For instance, in earlier posts, you can see some speculation,
descriptions of how I understand things as I look at more materials,
and so on.

If I learn something useful, hopefully I will remember it so I can
learn from and continue to apply that wisdom/knowledge.

Maybe by writing that stuff down and explicating a bit more at how I
arrive at such-and-such thought can be helpful not only for me to
remember useful things, but may even be helpful for someone in who
finds themselves in a similar situation... to learn from what
does(n't) work for me.

Accountability
--------------

Frequent blog posting will for me mean making sure I have worthwhile
things to report. Have I been lazy and negligent, or am I working on
myself such that I have things to share about the struggles I will
naturally face. [^1]

Things for this week
--------------------

When "studying", shorter and concentrated sessions are often
preferable to longer and distracted sessions. Ten minutes of paying
attention is better than an hour gone by without thinking in front of
some books. Less "intellectually laborious" time can be spent on
manual tasks, exercise, etc.

[^1]: In this lifetime, the fight is never over.
