A friend I met through the Internet shared this
[jaysanalysis](https://jaysanalysis.com/) with me. So far, I've been
really impressed by the quality/depth of the content.
There's a handful of topics here that interest me, including

- Christianity, Church history
- Cultural/symbol analysis
- Geopolitics

I think I've mentioned on this blog once or twice about my interest in
looking into more Orthodox Christianity stuff. Some issues with
(Evangelical) Protestantism I've tried to work through, in no
particular order

- Philosophical problems (e.g. problem of evil; what is "belief" in
  *sola fide*; where does scripture come from in *sola scriptura?*
- Lack of tradition, historical roots; many songs/images/etc of modern
  Christian movements look like whatever advertising is popular.
  Constant new materials instead of engaging classic works [^1]
- Uninspiring/bad aesthetics ("hippie rock concert")&mdash;doesn't
  *feel* holy
  
I hope that through spending some time studying Orthodoxy, including
doing more readings of the Church Fathers [^2]

Diving into the work of content creators
----------------------------------------

Since 2010 or so, there's been a handful of content creator people's
work I've engaged a lot. Each, I've found especially engaging for some
personal reason.

For instance, on this blog, I've shared some links to the work of [Luke
Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/). A bit older than me, I was surprised
to see how he had similar thoughts that I did about stuff that I did,
and went further doing more homework/research and producing more
content on these topics than I had done.

Pretty much no news has been good
----------------------------------

Spending more time reading books, talking with people, etc. has been
very good. I only keep up with enough news to know what I'm allowed
to/not allowed to do, and often I can find this out through *other
people* without even opening social media.

Some practical suggestions for making media consumption a better use
of time,

- Make default homepages on your web browsers blank or something
  really dry and boring (e.g. the weather in California)&mdash;this
  shields you from getting attention splashed with what others push on
  you; you can start your Internet interaction with what you decided
  to look at
- Whenever possible, consume *older* media first&mdash;choose a novel
  from 50 years ago rather than 5 years ago. One upside of consuming
  older media is you can probably find more informative
  commentary/analysis as well (e.g. reviews on old movies)
- Whenever possible, consume *longer form* media* if you are
  interested in a subject; e.g. if you're going to express an opinion
  about Afghanistan, see if there is some old book by someone on
  Afghanistan and read that rather than assuming you understand the
  context of some rando Twitter remark. If you are unwilling to do
  your homework, don't be an echo chamber conduit if you don't have to
  be.
- Jump past the first Google results *purposely*; try to go to
  *anywhere other than Wikipedia* first. Then, go to Wikipedia.
- If you choose to browse news sites, *intentionally do some "meta
  analysis"*. Scroll back a week or two and see what the past week's
  headlines as an aggragate look like before jumping to the present.
  Appreciate the bias of a newspaper, e.g. you can expect CNN to push
  one sort of narrative, RT to push another, and so on and so forth.

Using the strategies above, I would like to think that I keep my views
more *independent* in the sense that I don't just plug myself into the
Google hivemind and accept the first few results; hopefully these
techniques facilitate exercising *critical thinking* in that they
force me to *slow down* and take time to digest the various forms of
messaging thrown at me.

In the coming months, I'll probably be doing some more reading on
communications, adverising, and that sort of thing.

[^2]: E.g. the people listed
    [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers). In
    protestant land, I don't think I learned much about these people
    at all; rather, we focused on theology through secondary,
    contemporary sources and the text of the 66-book protestant Bible
