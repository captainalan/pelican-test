title: Corona Virus Diary, Part 33

The day felt rather slow today, though not in a bad way. It felt like
a deliberate, rather than reactive day. I've (literally) slowed down
my metabolism (not eating so much right now) so this may be affecting
my perception of stuff as more even paced and calm.

Reflexively, I've been avoiding news/media turning instead to long
form things (e.g. books, detailed technical docs/website) as well as
relatively direct chat through messaging apps and
stuff&mdash;thankfully these aren't plastered with ads (yet?). [^1]

Reading good, long-form content motivates me to take the time to write
longer-form, better thought out posts than the stuff I'm pumping out
here. Until we "return to normal" (provided that *does* happen, haha)
I'll plan on making these entries, though afterwards I hope to make
some longer and better researched pieces that are articulated in a
more "future proof" way.

[^1]: Though I assume everything I'm saying is getting logged
    somewhere. *C'est la vie.*
