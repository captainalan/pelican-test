Using old hardware, having **swap** space in addition to RAM can make your
computer operate more smoothly.

From a fresh 'buntu Install
---------------------------

After a fresh Lubuntu on an old machine (with only 2 GB of RAM), I followed the
directions on ["Create a Linux swap
file"](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/create-a-linux-swap-file/)
(Rackspace 2018) to create a swap file [^1].

You can use the `htop` command to see a summary of the processes running on
your computer in addition to CPU and memory usage.

[^1]: Remember that Linux distributions are for the most part just bundled
  software and default configurations. Choosing Ubuntu (or some 'buntu
  "flavor") is an easy way to get a widely documented default setup going.
