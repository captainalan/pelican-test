**Libraries** of earlier times were primarily collections of (paper) books.
Nowadays, many things which may have been previously stored on paper are found
in databases on servers. A "digital transformation" is largely complete. 

There are lots of different sorts of books
------------------------------------------

When modern people think of books, people often think of types like **novels**
or "non-fiction" books&mdash;documents on history, politics, etc.

Likewise, we have practical books like **cookbooks** and manuals. Many (most?)
people don't bother using paper books for these. Instead, they'll look up
recipes online, access the most recent documentation for some machine...

### Digital assets

Another type of "library" is an (originally) digital collection.
Libraries of digital assets can be things like,

- Software libraries
- 3D textures, models
- Stock images

Artists might buy reference books full of many images of a particular
type&mdash;e.g. birds, swordsman poses

Once you have a useful set of pre-made things, you can compose them in ways
that are useful to you provided you have the necessary skill. Libraries save
time because you don't have to re-do "re-inventing the wheel" or doing
"original research" (which can be costly and time consuming).

The dangers of (digital) centralization
---------------------------------------

The new digital way of doing libraries has a lot of problems. Crucially, if a
"client-server" setup where you access a library through your terminal (e.g.
smartphone, web browser), you *do not control the resources you are accessing*.
While practically, we cannot control everything we use&mdash;the modern way is
to be in a highly networked world&mdash;certain stuff which we access everyday
is probably best left de-centralized.

One example of this is a "music library". Nowadays, many people turn over their
music listening to a service like Spotify. What happened to having a curated
collection of carefully selected things to listen to?  Now *somebody else* can
alter your music collection remotely.

Centralized control means that 3rd parties (big corporations, governments) can 
control what information people have access to. Obviously, this can be used to
"control the narrative", to-down.

### "You don't know what you're missing"

People born into this system of digital centralized control will not have the
same experiences of browsing libraries, open forums of discussion, and other more organic means of *discovery*.

Rather, information is being fed to people like how a *guided tour* seeks to
contextualize and control how visitors see some place.
