There is **theory**, which can be understood as a (intellectual) model
of *how something works*, and then there is **practice** in which
theory can be applied to get results. Another word for practice is
**work**, in the case that the thing being practiced is applied
towards some end with effects in the real world&mdash;e.g. you can
*practice* baking pizzas through your *work* of making pizzas to
please customers.

The Nerd's Folly
================

The nerd has *theory* but fails in *practice*. For instance, a nerd
may have lots of knowledge about health/fitness things in the sense of
*textbook learning*. Failure to apply this knowledge in practice gives
this person the appearance of a *hypocrite*&mdash;if they are soooooo
smart, then why can they not apply their theory for results?

Babbling on about theory before confirming it experientially by
putting it into practice can be very bad because it can *turn people
away from good theory* as they look first at the character and results
its proponents put forth.

Nerds ought to inspect themselves and be humble. If they're smarter
than everyone about XYZ software, can they direct a software project
to produce something better than the existing solutions? Many people
*can* and *do* quietly labor in this way, doing quality work *not
through first announcing their theory* but by gradually refining their
methods through tireless toil.

Working Knowledge
=================

Knowledge should be useful for some kind of *work*; that which isn't
can be called "idle", "speculative", etc. [^1]

Work can be done on lots of things. There is work on developing
*ourselves*. [^2] Also, there is work on the external world for the
purpose of making money, getting food, moving from place to place,
etc.

When theory is in excess or in error, bad theory should be refuted and
discarded and good theory should be retained and put to practice. More
theory (not necessarily *new theory* [^3]) should be sought out when
the the current theoretical resources are insufficient to accomplish
the work at hand.

[^1]: Speculative need not be bad&mdash;there are times when we have
    to think of different possibilities of how something might be done
    (or how something may have come), and then we make judgements or
    decisions regarding these possibilies
[^2]: How a person will interpret this statement will depend on how
    you interpret a person&mdash;e.g. does a person consist of
    mind/body/spirit?
[^3]: You might only know a certain amount of theory, e.g. a handful
    of grammatical constructions in a foreign language, but know these
    things well. Learning often consists of learning *more* theory of
    that which is already known, rather than doing something like...
    making a constructed language and coming up with a *new* theory.
