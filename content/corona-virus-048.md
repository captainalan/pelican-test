title: Corona Virus Diary, Part 48

Today's post will be kind of scattered; there's a few ideas I want to
discuss.

Productivity Strategy: Circuits
-------------------------------

In a [previous blog
post](https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-42.html)
I briefly discussed how iterating through different "stations" (e.g.
doing a workout routine with various machines, doing a fixed number of
reps on each machine) could be a good strategy to keep a workout
going, allowing parts of your body to rest while maintaining
momentum/intensity.

This week I've been working on developing this idea further by
bringing this into the abstracted/software/computaitonal world as
well. One could *cycle* through different projects; working on one
until you hit some road block, making some notes about how you think
you should pick stuff up next time you start, and then moving on to
the next thing. This way you keep multiple projects going (and hence
get stuff done) and also do not get too held up on the frustrations of
any one product.

Philosophy not in the "philosophy" genre
----------------------------------------

You may have heard stuff about how the ancient greeks/chinese/etc.
studied "philosophy" was different from the rather obscure field it is
today. What we now classify as "ancient philosophy" can be a
combination of practical how-to's, religious revalations, texts on
governing, etc.

Here I think it is important to consider how today's *genres* are very
specific things; perhaps if were to take today's collections of text,
we might call things like

- self-help books
- pop psychology, pop science
- marketing, communications, business writing
- assorted blogs on the internet

...philosophy?!

Going further back in time, we have less and less knowledge about what
was written vs what survived; the ability to use writing and make
documents that lasted was far less widespread too.

Programing Language Study: Ruby
-------------------------------

I worked through the [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/).

Lots of ideas that are common among Nodejs programers may have come
from Ruby; for example the "Agile" movement, Test Driven Development
(TDD), and other ways of organizing programer laber...

Approaching Ruby, I'm trying to make extensive use of both the
interactive interpreter (`irb`) and offline documentation (`ri`). The
idea here is that being able to quickly discover new things about a
language as you work in it is a good strategy to be able to continue
moving and learning in a language and not to get hung/up stuck due to
lack of momentum.

## Juggling

This week, I started to do some more juggling. I first learned how to
do this during my elementary school years (long ago). Why would I move
away from it and then come back later?

In summary, I stopped doing juggling and started doing other things
because there were things that were more interesting to me.

However, now juggling is once again interesting to me to practice because

1. I want some physical activity that is relatively quiet, can be done
   in small space,
2. Is not so physically exhausting that it can be done for long
   periods of time without respite
3. Is analog (lol, as in... not digital, doesn't need the Internet)

So basically I can do some casual juggling practice as
recreation/sport while listening to music, watching videos, hanging
out with others, etc. Not bad!
