</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I started watching some videos by this fellow, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkB8eF4ATHl4Jm1BeCZgQ9A">Uneducated
Economist</a>.
You can think about "economy" in terms of something like US dollars...
and then you can think about it more broadly in terms of the exchange
of goods and services (and how stuff like supply, demand, taxation,
etc impact this). The channel linked here is useful for looking at how
stuff is happening "from the ground up" rather than from fancy
theoretical concepts.</p>
<p>On this blog I've done some discussion of how many of the contemporary
"new" things we have are just transformations of older, existing
technologies; for example, if I think about how I use a computer
<em>functionally</em>, I'll find that the main tasks I do have to do with
communication. What might have been in the past things like <em>letter
writing</em> or <em>creating a newsletter</em> (to post on some physical board)
somewhere).</p>
<p>We can look at systems/society at large in a similar way, and thus
apply ancient wisdom. For instance, we have relatively new things like
<strong>cryptocurrencies</strong>; we can then ask, <em>what sort of things are
these?</em> Analyzing cryptocurrencies as something that has been around
since as long as human civilization (e.g. "people essentially treat
bitcoin like <em>gold</em>) we can see past all of the buzzwords/hype and
better understanding what is going on.</p>
