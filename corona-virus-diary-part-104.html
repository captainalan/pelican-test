</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I looked over this piece, <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/3/250710-the-decline-of-computers-as-a-general-purpose-technology/fulltext">"The Decline of Computers as a General Purpose
Technology"</a>
which I found on Hacker News (via <a href="https://skimfeed.com">skimfeed</a>, a news
aggregator). Indeed there are generic "personal computers" suitable for demands
of school/work/etc. The Chromebook is a microcosm of the browser-based
"subscription machine"&mdash;by choosing to operate on a Chromebook a user is
seeking a low-cost, functional solution to what most people do with technology:
<em>interfacing with Big Tech</em>. Users with more specific needs will know they need
other tools. For instance, a business may know they need to purchase servers, a
gamer may know about the latest fancy graphics cards, and a YouTuber may know
some things about audio and video equipment and network speed requirements.</p>
<h2>Diversity via Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Consider <em>birds</em>. Different birds have different ways of living; some have long
necks to dip in the water, other birds have beaks that are effective at
different tasks&mdash;pecking holes, crushing seeds, etc.</p>
<p>This is a general pattern we see everywhere; and as described above with
technology, <em>we can't really get away from this pattern</em>. While we might try to
impose requirements to standardize systems (consider: a fast food chain),
hierarchy always seems to come back and similar sorts of divisions are found
again and again. </p>
<p>With "computers", of various kinds we're seeing patterns like...</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone is expected to have a "smartphone" (nowadays usually just called a
  <em>phone</em>); this is used to verify ID and stuff</li>
<li>You are expected to have a mailbox (e-mail) and a "desk" (office software)</li>
<li>People have various forms of "recreation"&mdash;notice how gaming has become
  more "inclusive" in that it includes people of all ages, male and female,
  etc; watching videos online is something most people do</li>
<li>Social media accounts as well as accounts on big platforms like Amazon and
  Ebay are analogs to various places you may go&mdash;the marketplace, social
  gatherings etc</li>
</ul>
<p>The above things form the digital "person" which governments, employers, etc
can track you with. Having the hardware of a phone is basically all that is
required for this. This is the "baseline" urban person.</p>
<p>Now, there are ways in which we can "upgrade" our digital "person". I once
jokingly said something like, "if you give me a laptop, I can do ten times as
much as I could without one"&mdash;indeed many of the "skills" that people
train themselves for these days rely on certain <em>systems</em> being in place.</p>
<p>Going above and beyond the baseline phone'd "person", we have different
divisions. First, there are the "latest phone" type people; often, these people
are well-paid so they can enjoy the latest equipment to... go on and post to
social media, buy stuff through platforms, etc. This is like <code>Normie++</code>; this
sort of person doesn't need to possess any specialized technical knowledge or
anything, but because of their place in society they are distinguished by
having a fancier phone. This is similar to having expensive, name brand
clothes.</p>
<p>Next, there are the technician "power users" of the first order. Often these
people have laptops or desktop computers. They understand a little bit about
what they are using beyond the average uncritical user. I would put many (PC)
gamers into this category; they are aware of different machines&mdash;otherwise
they might just purchase a console and play games in the sort of "uniform" way
that a <code>Normie++</code> would. I'll call this group <code>PC Gamers</code>.</p>
<p>Then we have <code>Capitalists</code> who don't just <em>consoom</em> with their electronic
devices;  they actively are involved in getting money in some way or another by
making use of their technology. These people approach computers not just as a
"home" for the digital "person", they operate on computers as a business. I
would include "content creator" types in this category&mdash;for them, places
like YouTube are not just for play/exploration&mdash;they are for <em>business</em>.
People directly involved in buying/selling good and services related to
augmenting the digital "person" are here.</p>
<p>Another group of people I'll call <code>untouchscreenables</code>. These people reject 
the digital "person" as much as possible OR are people that simply can't/won't
learn the "new way of doing things". In some respect, these people are "out of
the system", but in other ways they are simply just <em>not inputting into the
system</em>. You see, social media sites may create <strong>shadow profiles</strong> of you,
inferring your existence from other people's communications... <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, there are the <code>Feds</code>. These people may be literal federal agents, or
they might be people like big tech workers who have direct sway over hardware &amp;
software (the "fabric" of the matrix) and digital "persons".</p>
<p>The categories I give above can of course be debated, reformulated, and so on,
but the general point is that <em>there is a hierarchy</em> and we can find <em>distinct
types</em>. In the natural world, we can see how different animals have different
characteristics. Likewise, we see that people fall into patterns. And even in a
new, human-made thing like the Internet and this big network of machines, we
don't see everyone becoming a build-a-PC hobbyist nerd. Rather, we see distinct
classes arise.</p>

<p>This is one reason I choose to keep social media. Even if I delete my
  profiles, I'll expect them to "still be there". So at least I might have some
  control if I keep "my" accounts...&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
