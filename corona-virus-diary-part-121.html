</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Time and attention cannot be replaced; a day cannot be redone. On the
other hand, you <em>can</em> earn more money. So it is a false equivalence
that "time is money"&mdash;as the saying goes "money can't buy you
more time". Time and attention well spent will continue to pay you
(e.g. if you have cultivated <strong>virtues</strong>, built up good
relationships). However, lots of money made and spent today might
leave you no different (or worse) tomorrow; imagine earning a
$150k/year salary in some high tech job and you have a proportionally
scaling luxurious lifestyle... ...and then you get laid off. Having
bet your lifestyle on some "guaranteed" income where do you then find
yourself?</p>
<p>If you had spent your time/attention doing useful things like
developing strong attention, learning generally useful technologies,
and so on and so forth, then this discipline will continue to pay you.
However, if you landed some position as a grifter and really didn't
learn anything... well now all you have is burnt time.</p>
<h2>"There is no such thing as a free lunch"</h2>
<p>Doing some (residence) moving has been educational.</p>
<p>Getting items for "free" has a heavy price. When we take on additional
possessions (or hobbies/interests for that matter), we not only need
more <em>physical</em> space, but we also give up the time that is needed to
manage these things.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned here, I've done some buying and selling on
Facebook marketplace. This will make you appreciate (normal) stores
for their convenience&mdash;buying or selling things can involve a
lengthy process of figuring out logistics, buyers/sellers flaking,
etc. So what may have <em>sounded</em> like a $40 "profit" may end up being
an hour of time spent over a fews days dealing with the listing(s),
communications, etc. That being said, if you accept a bunch of stuff
for free and then intend to go sell it, you may end up spending a lot
of time doing so. Of course if you could afford to <em>pay</em> someone to do
Facebook marketplace for you full-time, I think you could effectively
use it to clear out lots of items and maybe even make some decent
money. However, for most people that just have <em>too much stuff</em>, you
find yourself with a much bigger time sink than say... having an
estate/garage sale for a day.</p>
<p>One way to avoid lots of complication is to stay focused, acquire
things that are useful and/or easy to resell or give away, and to
avoid "novelty" items, cheap decorations, etc. Rather than buying a
(fake) plastic plant, why not just keep a nice (real) house plant? If
you really gotta purge a house plant, you return the plant to the
earth&mdash;humans have been doing this for as long as they've been
around. You can avoid dumpsters/pollution/trouble...</p>
<h2>"Out of sight, out of mind."</h2>
<p>Introducing complication to your life means more time spent sorting
through your confusion.</p>
<p>Not seeing what is happening doesn't mean that it is not happening.
For instance, many people think it is somehow <em>virtuous</em> to do more
cooking than eating out. Now, certainly learning some cooking is a
useful thing to do... however, to elevate cooking too much is not
good. Without a proper kitchen, proper cooking can be very difficult.
But I don't think it would be right for you to try to build out a
really fancy kitchen for an occasional homecooked meal so you could
say to yourself "aha! I'm a responsible adult". Better is to learn
some simple, effective cooking with minimal supplies and save more
complicated cooking for when you have access to a more complete
kitchen.</p>
<p>Americans try to do a lot of things at home. For instance, many people
buy lots of expensive exercise equipment. This is fine if you use it
frequently; you can have a very nice setup this way. However, for many
people (e.g. those dwelling in small-ish apartments), it makes more
sense to make use of a gym, the outdoors, or even friends' equipment
(with their permission of course) rather than dishing out the extra
dollars for more stuff that takes up more space.</p>
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>People give you money in order to sove problems for them. Although
"free stuff" may <em>sound</em> like you are getting a really good deal,
maybe more of what is going on is kind of the opposite&mdash;sometimes
I may agree to take on some burden&mdash;e.g. accept an item from a
family member which I really don't want <em>effectively so that family
member cannot "feel bad" about "throwing something away". But what
often happens is that the issue of extra item ABC is pushed onto </em>me*
and that thing is "out of sight, out of mind" for the giver.The gift
is to the giver.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that we <em>shouldn't</em> give things away; rather when we
get things "for free" we should consider what we are going to do with
the items we get and be willing to say "no" when we are unwilling or
unable to shoulder some additional burden.</p>
<p>It is better to prevent problems than to have to work through and
correct them (which takes more time, energy); so if you can avoid
buying stuff you'll have to "get rid of" (e.g. some rando "gift item")
then this takes away the "should I throw it away?" burden from
yourself or another person. On the other hand, gifts like flowers,
food items, etc (I call these "consumable") more intuitively have a
short "lifespan".</p>
