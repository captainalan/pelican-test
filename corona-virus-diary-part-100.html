</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Is it time to throw a hundreth post party?! Nah; let's instead talk
about how <em>counting</em> and numerical measures in general are used as
(artificial) markers.</p>
<p>What is the significance of a 100th post? That a blog has been going
on for a while? Why not celebrate a 98th post? Especially considering
that I don't write new posts here on a regular schedule (e.g. daily),
what does "100" even signify?</p>
<p>Here is where we start to talk about <em>meaning</em>. Different numbers <em>do
mean different things to people</em>.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin goes above $50k soon, that will be a psychological
significant marker. It is "halfway to $100k".</p>
<p>Numbers are words we use to describe reality just like other words.
For many people, just adding numbers to stuff makes it sound "smart".
Spouting a bunch of numbers is sufficient to confound many people and
make them accept you as an expert. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<h2>The Cult of Data-Driven Decision Making</h2>
<p>People these days are obsessed with counting stuff and then turning
knobs and flipping switches to optimize things. While certainly there
is a time and a place to optimize stuff, the efficacy of optimizations
can only help as far as the underlying assumptions about how some
system works.</p>
<p>So for example, an educator might optimize some cirriculum such that
students score as high as possible on some kind of standardized test.</p>
<p>Has <em>LEARNING</em> therefore been optimized?</p>
<p>Well, the students may improve at taking some specific type of test,
but this doesn't imply that education got "better" in a more holistic
sense.</p>
<p>Similarly, people might apply this sort of thinking to topics like
diet. Someone might try to go for a maximum "low-fat" or "low-carb"
diet. Sure, there are correlations between certain metrics, but does
optimizing for one of these things miss other important "big-picture"
questions like <em>what is my relationship to food</em> (to begin with).
Furthermore, only looking at metrics like those found on nutrition
fact labels may not distinguish between important considerations about
what we're eating&mdash;is "grass fed" the same as "normal" meat?</p>
<p>Putting on the blinders of numbers can be helpful for focusing and
improving certain systems. However, as illustrated by the <strong>thought
experiment</strong> of the "Artificial Intelligence" system that decides to
exterminate all humans in order to optimize paper-clip production,
narrowly specified goals (often which rely on some numeric accounting
thing) can lead us to engineer our own destruction.</p>
