</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Aside from work, I spent some time today investigating (Theravada)
Buddhism by reading <em>In the Buddha's Words: An Anthology of Discourses
from the Pali Canon</em>, which I bought used a while back. [^1]
I had this book on the shelf for a while and was interested in reading
something a bit more ancient the 20th century stuff and contemporary
things I've been reading lately.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, I don't have any Buddhism stuff in my
direct line of descent, though it is such an old way of doing things,
I would be surprised if there wasn't any going back into my Chinese
ancestry. <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">1</a></sup> Mainly, I'm looking into these things out of
curiosity and for knowledge&mdash;I'm not trying to "convert" or
anything.</p>
<h2>Impressions</h2>
<p>Below are some of my impressions&mdash;a practicing Buddhist may want
to reach out to me and correct my misunderstandings here. What follows
is an outsider's perspective.</p>
<h3>Tiers</h3>
<p>One thing interesting about Buddhism compared with the Christianity I
know is that Buddhism is a very much "choose your own adventure" type
of religion. Practitioners of Buddhism may be lay people that try to
suffer and aquire good <em>kamma</em> (Sanskrit: Karma) by following "best
practices", <em>or</em> they can live life in super hard mode and strive for
"release" from the sufferings of this world.</p>
<p>Many recommendations for lay people reminded me of Confucian
ideas&mdash;defining proper relations between different sorts of
people (e.g. Children and Parents, Husbands and Wives). This is on one
hand unsurprising, but also has got me thinking about <em>how Buddhism
became very popular in China</em> during various times/places in Chinese
history.</p>
<h3>Doing nothing</h3>
<p>Compared with Christianity, it seems that Buddhism supports a lot
of... inaction. In Christiandom, the <em>Protestant work ethic</em> is
(in)famous&mdash;industriousness is valued not only for the products
of work in of itself but also as a means for fighting against
temptation and sin.</p>
<p>In contrast, Buddhism has <em>meditation</em> as a central practice. Poverty,
homelessness, and being at the charity of others are required for
pursuing Buddha-dom.</p>
<p>Rather than having an integration of serious religious practitioners
and "normal" working/daily life, Buddhism divides "serious"
practitioners from lay practioners, and the <em>professionals</em> are
devoted full-time to practices which do not directly contribute <em>work</em>
to society (e.g. by producing food).</p>
<h3>Starting from the self</h3>
<p>It seems lots of stuff in Buddhism you are supposed to do because <em>it
makes sense to do in order to reduce suffering</em>. There is a kind of
empirical, internal justification that I think has appealed to many
Westerners. <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> From a Christian perspective, this may make a lot of
Buddhism seem rather... <strong>amoral</strong> (c.f. <em>(im)moral</em>).</p>
<h2>More later</h2>
<p>More to come as I study more; these are some quick initial thoughts.</p>

<p>I never had any contact with relatives <em>in China</em> to the best of
my knowledge; seems I am many generations back Chinese-American
(3+). Before widespread literacy and such it is harder to trace
back further than that.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
