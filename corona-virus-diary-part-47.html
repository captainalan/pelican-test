</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Faced with scarcity, people naturally plan. It is necessary to be
efficienct when resources are few.</p>
<ul>
<li>Going on a camping trip with limited food, you'll have to decide
  <em>what</em> to eat <em>when</em></li>
<li>Knowing you only get <em>one hour to study</em> for some exam, you'll want
  to know what the most effective study methods are to extract the
  most out of this hour</li>
<li>Constrained by a budget (e.g. <em>your own money</em>), you will aim to get
  the best deals you can; with tooling, you will want to buy quality
  things that you won't have to soon replace</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, abundance can lead to great waste in time, energy,
and resources.</p>
<h2>Simulating Scarcity</h2>
<p>Schedules and structuring time can be used to make "artificial
scarcity"; you can trick yourself to being more efficient by imposing
scenarios on yourself that necessitate planning.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you make a plan to eat only one meal per day, you will want to
  plan to eat something that tastes good and is nutritious. You may
  arrange your social life around enjoying this one meal <em>with other
  people</em>.</li>
<li>You may alot different time blocks for studying different subjects;
  e.g. focus on studying for one exam for an hour, working on another
  project for two, etc.</li>
<li>Your budgeting plan may amount to deciding to <em>save</em> a certain
  portion of the money you bring in on a fixed interval.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Degrees of Freedom</h2>
<p>Of course, having the flexibility to change/adjust plans to meet new
requirements (or ride <em>waves of inspiration</em>) is a helpful thing.</p>
<p>What needs to be done is to strike a balance between having enough
structure to keep one motivated/working/productive and enough freedom
to capitalize on unforseen events. Good organization is organization
that makes sense to do, which you don't have to constantly think
about.</p>
