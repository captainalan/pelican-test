video</a>
video in which he pointed out a common pattern for introducing global
changes. Start with some grand narrative, e.g. <em>climate change due to
carbon emissions</em>. Then, take some terrible exemplar of what something
current looks like&mdash;e.g. a factory farm. Next, beat this
easy-to-hate <strong>strawman</strong> as a representative with some entire
position&mdash;in this example <em>people should be free to consume
meat</em>. Furthermore, no explanation is given for how the current
situation arose. Why is meat production so centralized these days to
begin with?</p>
<p>Narratives like the one above pull on the emotional strings of people
based on a truth&mdash;factory farms look nasty. But then, this image
is tied with things that are not so directly related to it. Does
sustaining human populations <em>demand</em> farming as we currently have it?</p>
<p>Going in the other direction, we can see how all sorts of things get
attached to labels like <strong>"education"</strong> and <strong>"science"</strong>. Getting
smeared as being "against education" or "against science" emotionally
manipulates people based ont he <em>positive</em> associations of these
terms.</p>                </article>
