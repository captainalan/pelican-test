</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Prediction time! In this post I will analyze the current <strong>Old World
Bat Pestilence</strong> (COVID-19) situation (mainly California, where I
live). The idea here is that I make some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsifiable</a> claims
that I can either,</p>
<ol>
<li>smirk to myself about predicting correctly (and maybe make some
   bucks of stock trades and stuff)</li>
<li>analyze stuff to see why I was wrong and hopefully learn something</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, I do a write-up here because it is more interesting
than being wish-washy and saying "it's complicated" without making any
concrete predictions.</p>
<h2>No "Universal Vaccination"</h2>
<p>I don't think that we'll see a widely accepted vaccine being developed
in the next month or two. By the time something is developed, I think
that the main "scare" of COVID-19 will be past.  Already, we see many
places starting to open up <em>despite there being no vaccine</em>.</p>
<p>Some sub-claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things will continue opening up, regardless if there is a vaccine or not.</li>
<li>If a vaccine is developed, stuff will likely already be sufficiently
  opened up that people will opt out of taking it unless forced to
  (e.g. by their employer, government mandate)</li>
<li>Overall, I think more people will start getting flu shots and stuff
  after COVID-19, but institutional skepticism on a whole will
  likewise grow</li>
<li>Forced vaccination will be met with resistance from vocal
  minorities; in practice I think you can't force everyone to have a
  vaccine.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remote Work Will Grow, But Not Dramatically</h2>
<p>Many people got to "experiment" with remote work. Most people I have
talked with that have kept their jobs <em>don't like remote work</em>. With
certain exceptions (e.g. computer programers), I think that
by-in-large, people will want to continue working in offices.</p>
<p>Nerds often think that other people have "rational" motivation
structures like them. They fail to see that,</p>
<ul>
<li>Many (most?) people are strongly driven by external motivation,
  which can be negative (fear of punishment) or positive (praise,
  raises, etc.); traditional workplaces make it easier to deliver
  these incentives than remote work which puts a lot of
  technology-fiddling overhead on most involved</li>
<li>Most people at some point declare "technological bankruptcy"; they
  simply decide they don't/can't use XYZ technology and stop learning
  more; learning new tech all the time is something nerds gravitate
  towards, but most people hate doing this and will resist change</li>
<li>Remote work <em>is costly</em>; while paying rent for an office is
  expensive, wasting time dealing with people's failing microphones,
  noisy backgrounds, accidental screenshares, etc. wastes a lot of
  time</li>
</ul>
<p>Many jobs filled with people already well-prepared for remote work
will likely continue exploring/expanding remote operations.</p>
<p>However, I think there will be a general trend for non-nerd work to
<em>not</em> become more remote; many people have tried remote work and
decided <em>they don't like it</em>.</p>
<h2>The Establishment Will Survive (and Thrive)</h2>
<p>Many small businesses might get hit very hard, but the big players are
likely to sale through all of this stuff OK. Many tech stocks are
likely to do quite well, e.g. Amazon. I think that banks and oil will
also end up OK because of how tied up in government things they are;
the establishment is continuing the "too big to fail" thing.</p>
<p>I think that banks, companies, etc. will have rather lenient policies
for repaying loans and stuff <em>for the time being</em>&mdash;meaning, we're not
going to see thugs from credit card companiesknocking on people's
doors demanding money any time soon.</p>
<p>However, like college debt, I think that repayment stuff <em>will be
remembered</em> by the establishment and there will be nothing like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_(biblical)">The
Jubilee</a> given
to those hard hit by COVID-19, just temporary "good enough" relief to
prevent angry mobs with pitchforks and fire.</p>
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>As the COVID-19 stuff slowly wraps up, I think that people will emerge
with dramatically different conclusions. Many prepper/right-wing types
will emerge feeling vindicated for taking things into their own hands
and preparing supplies and stuff before all this virus business.
They&mdash;along with many religious people&mdash;will (correctly) see
that,</p>
<ul>
<li>Times of chaos can and will be used by governments to extend usual
  authority and implement new "temporary" policies</li>
<li>"Temporary" measures put in place during times of emergency may be
  used for all sorts of tricky stuff later (see 9-11, PATRIOT Act, and
  the expansion of the surveillance state)</li>
<li>Many on the political left would like a more "maternal" state caring
  for (and controlling) the population in various ways, e.g. pushing
  solutions for how the nation <em>as a whole</em> should evaluate and
  respond to risk</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, more left-leaning types will emerge feeling
vindicated by (correctly) seeing,</p>
<ul>
<li>Their nations are ununified; struggles between different groups and
  partisan media that focuses on <em>differences</em> rather than on how
  people are similar</li>
<li>Many rejecting mainstream science (acting like "idiots" in their
  view); we will see many examples of more right-wing type people
  dying and stuff because they didn't listen to the establishment</li>
<li>A more urgent demand/need for healthcare reform (or <em>¡revolución!</em>)
  in the United States</li>
<li>How capitalism as a sole operating principle doesn't solve
  everything (think: critique of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3164890827?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1"><em>Atlas
  Shrugged</em></a>
  by Ayn Rand)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't expect to see much jumping from one side or the other of the
political spectrum. Left-leaning people will dig deeper into the need
for institutional solutions while more libertarian x right-leaning
people will want the establishment to
<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BTFO">BTFO</a>.  Both
the left and right broadly (no, you <em>NUANCE BROS</em>, I'm not going to
"resist the dichotomy") will be able to find validation for their
worldviews.</p>
<p>Though, all in all, I think the right-wingers will come out feeling a
lot better than the left-wingers overall. This is because the
left-wingers want institutional solutions to what they perceive as
problems, and COVID-19 (metaphorically) kicked the establishment in
the balls. The establishment is rolling around in pain a little bit
now <em>and</em> Bernie Sanders is not the Dem party blessed
choice. Meanwhile, right wingers with their values in self-sufficiency
and building up families and communities (rather than exploring the
arts) rather than state power (okay, now I'm talking more about
<strong>libertarian</strong> leaning right-wing types, not war-hawk hegemonic
theocratic types) will emerge from all of this feeling like had been
on the right track before all of this with their trucks, guns, and
gallons of water.</p>                </article>
