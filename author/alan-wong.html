<p>In <a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/category/fun.html">Fun</a>.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>A prerequisite for fun is that <em>whatever tooling/technology you are
using doesn't get in the way of what you want to be doing</em>. Fun must
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>&mdash;un-fun
blockers are a no go.</p>
<p>For instance, I enjoy riding bicycles. But when I get flat tires, this
is <em>annoying</em>. I often go run instead of bicycling so I don't have to
deal with problem that comes up every now and then and ruins my fun.
It is possible to restore fun by enjoying walking one's bike miles to
get back home, but then this to is because presuming that your <em>feet
work</em>. If you got a flat tire <em>and then</em> a sprained ankle, chances are
you wouldn't be having much fun.</p>
<h2>Technology and Fun</h2>
<p>One of the reasons I think playing video games is more fun than office
work for lots of people is that a game a nice self-contained
environment (we'll assume it isn't buggy) with clearly defined goals.</p>
<p>Simple, easy to use things are more accessible fun. This is one reason
I think many "gamification" approaches are successful.  By simplifying
the complex nature of some situation into a space with well-defined
WIN/LOSE conditions, people are more likely to quickly achieve fun
than if they had to meticulously design these sytems themselves (the
managers/engineers who make these systems may have a lot of fun
designing these systems too).</p>
<h3>Some Examples from Programing/Coding</h3>
<p>Coding websites are a popular way for people to practice
writing computer code. Despite having fancy gaming PCs, high-end
macbooks, etc., people everywhere are parking themselves in little
browser tabs to sort items in arrays and run their programs on
external/remote servers.</p>
<p>Some examples of these self-contained web-based environments, </p>
<ul>
<li>https://leetcode.com/</li>
<li>https://codepen.io/</li>
<li><a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">A Tour of Go</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I think that popularity of sites like these is due to easy
accessibility and gamification systems that give people positive
feedback. The "modern UIs" of these sites allow users to focus on one
task (e.g. writing code) ignoring the many layers and layers of
abstraction piled on top of each other to get there.</p>
<p>Personally, I haven't used these sites much at all, but I do enjoy
setting up a minimalistic text editing environment using dinosaur
software (e.g. emacs, bash). Doing data structure/algorithm problems
is fun to me because I can stay in my little contained stripped down
editor environment and not worry about importing this-and-that
library.</p>
<h3>Some Examples from Writing</h3>
<p>Many bloggers choose to use some flavor of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> to do their
work. It turns out that writing everything in plain text is often
faster/easier to do than using a more "full-featured" word processor
such as Microsoft Word. This is because you can focus on the
words/content of what you are doing rather than get distracted/blocked
by the many features of a word processor you will not use.</p>
<p>For people that write computer code of any sort, familiar editing
tools may allow you to use your own keybindings and stuff to work much
more seemlessly with text than using a word processor. It can almost
feel like "telepathy", magically making words appear when you are a
skilled typist in a comfy editor!</p>
<h3>Tools to be mastered</h3>
<p>Some programs are more useful than others. Having hundreds of
different hard-to-use, unmemorable programs scattered throughout a
computer will probably mean... using a computer isn't fun. Or, you
might just ignore all those programs and just play a game. A
full-screen game effectively allows you to ignore you messy desktop,
dozens of unread browser tabs, etc., and focus on fun.</p>
<p>Realizing just which programs are useful to you and keeping those
applications "well-maintained" is a good way to have fun using
computers.  It is more fun to go out on a bike ride if you know your
bicycle has properly inflated tires, an oiled chain, working lights
for the night, etc.</p>
<p>Similarly, when I sit down at the computer, I am happy knowing I am
able to do a handful of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browsers for communications, reading, documentation, etc.</li>
<li>Image editing software to produce content<ul>
<li>Krita for digital painting</li>
<li>MS Paint for maximum fun</li>
<li>GIMP for generic image editing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Environment to write computer code (mostly JavaScript) set up</li>
<li>Blogging tools (emacs + bash, command line interaction to update to
  GitHub pages)</li>
</ul>
<p>...and then many tools I intend to learn to use better eventually,</p>
<ul>
<li>Blender (3D modeling)</li>
<li>Various programing languages</li>
<li>Games, if I do get around to playing them</li>
</ul>
<p>What is crucial is that all of these things are ready to be launched
and used and that I know the steps to "get back into the flow of
things".</p>
<h2>Setting up for success</h2>
<p>If there is some activity you <em>should</em> be doing, then it makes sense
to set up your environment so that your technology will not get in the
way when you are trying to that activity. Then, you can start having
fun.</p>
<p>Sometimes, technology ruins fun by being too complicated. For these
reasons, to get into a habit such as "doing some artwork everyday", it
might be wise to ditch photoshop and instead use Paint (or an
<a href="https://jspaint.app/">in-browser equivalent</a>. You can revisit the
fancier software when you know clearly <em>why you need it</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly, to begin doing something like <em>exercising more</em> it may be
best to just start doing some easy to access exercise daily,
e.g. walking while listening to some podcast. Soon enough, this will
seem to easy (and perhaps not so "fun" as it is too relaxing) and you
can scale up the intensity of whatever you are doing.</p>
<p>In any case, it pays to have fun:</p>
<ul>
<li>to enjoy life</li>
<li>to have a sustainable lifestyle</li>
<li>to spread joy to others</li>
<li>[...]</li>
</ul>
<p>Really, <em>fun</em> shouldn't need a justification. So more fun and
equal/more productivity is better, all things considered. kk have fun.</p>                </article>
