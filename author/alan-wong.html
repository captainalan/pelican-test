</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><strong>Libraries</strong> of earlier times were primarily collections of (paper) books.
Nowadays, many things which may have been previously stored on paper are found
in databases on servers. A "digital transformation" is largely complete. </p>
<h2>There are lots of different sorts of books</h2>
<p>When modern people think of books, people often think of types like <strong>novels</strong>
or "non-fiction" books&mdash;documents on history, politics, etc.</p>
<p>Likewise, we have practical books like <strong>cookbooks</strong> and manuals. Many (most?)
people don't bother using paper books for these. Instead, they'll look up
recipes online, access the most recent documentation for some machine...</p>
<h3>Digital assets</h3>
<p>Another type of "library" is an (originally) digital collection.
Libraries of digital assets can be things like,</p>
<ul>
<li>Software libraries</li>
<li>3D textures, models</li>
<li>Stock images</li>
</ul>
<p>Artists might buy reference books full of many images of a particular
type&mdash;e.g. birds, swordsman poses</p>
<p>Once you have a useful set of pre-made things, you can compose them in ways
that are useful to you provided you have the necessary skill. Libraries save
time because you don't have to re-do "re-inventing the wheel" or doing
"original research" (which can be costly and time consuming).</p>
<h2>The dangers of (digital) centralization</h2>
<p>The new digital way of doing libraries has a lot of problems. Crucially, if a
"client-server" setup where you access a library through your terminal (e.g.
smartphone, web browser), you <em>do not control the resources you are accessing</em>.
While practically, we cannot control everything we use&mdash;the modern way is
to be in a highly networked world&mdash;certain stuff which we access everyday
is probably best left de-centralized.</p>
<p>One example of this is a "music library". Nowadays, many people turn over their
music listening to a service like Spotify. What happened to having a curated
collection of carefully selected things to listen to?  Now <em>somebody else</em> can
alter your music collection remotely.</p>
<p>Centralized control means that 3rd parties (big corporations, governments) can 
control what information people have access to. Obviously, this can be used to
"control the narrative", to-down.</p>
<h3>"You don't know what you're missing"</h3>
<p>People born into this system of digital centralized control will not have the
same experiences of browsing libraries, open forums of discussion, and other more organic means of <em>discovery</em>.</p>
<p>Rather, information is being fed to people like how a <em>guided tour</em> seeks to
contextualize and control how visitors see some place.</p>                </article>
