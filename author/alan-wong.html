</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>With great immaturity comes great power. This is the way (道)
of the <em>Chuu-ni-byou</em> warrior.</p>
<h2><em>Chuu-ni-byou</em></h2>
<p>Let us engage in some self-deprecation. Surely, most of us have at
least <em>felt</em> this way before?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chuunibyou</strong> (中二病; Chūnibyō) is a derogative colloquial term in
the Japanese language used to describe a person who manifests
delusional behavior, particularly thinking that one has special
powers that no other person has. Originally a term used to pertain
to children in the second year of middle school who act like adults,
the term eventually evolved into a term generally used to describe
delusional behavior in general.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://animanga.fandom.com/wiki/Chuunibyou">animanga.fandom.com</a></p>
<p>Maybe you realized you knew something that a parent or teacher didn't
know. Maybe you were better at something than all of your peers. Maybe
you truly believed you had some sort of super-natural powers.</p>
<p>While <em>Chuunibyou</em> may be used as an insult, we can embrace this term.</p>
<h2>With some imagination, your daily activities become heroic</h2>
<p>Being a student, a lowly corporate wage slave, or otherwise falling
into line to conform to societal norms may be not always be the most
fun thing in the world. Inject some immature thinking, however, and
the every day routine can become lots of fun.</p>
<h3>Desk jobs</h3>
<p>Knowing how to work a bunch of little programs is like knowing how to
cast a bunch of spells. Chaining them together to create solutions,
now that's <em>wizardry!</em> Composing emails is basically mind control
("delegation").</p>
<p>Magical items (computers) become more powerful in the hands of skilled
users. Understanding that when you skillfully operate a computer, you
are translating keystrokes (little finger movements) into BIG ACTIONS in
the real world.</p>
<h3>Practicing a musical instrument</h3>
<p>Let's look at another activity: playing musical instruments. To play a
musical instrument well you need to train a lot of fine motor control.
Plucking strings? Why that's basically <em>archery</em>.</p>
<h3>NEETing x Quarantine</h3>
<p>If you wanna be with others outside having fun but can't, you may be
experiencing <em>loneliness</em>. However, if you willfully choose this path,
you may be <em>persuing solitude</em>. Like a wise sage, a lone wolf rogue, a
hero on a journey...</p>
<h2>Adventure awaits</h2>
<p>Overcome by a sense of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ennui"><em>ennui</em></a>?</p>
<p>While you might not be literally slaying dragons out there,
channeling a little bit of immaturity, you can view your own</p>
<p>The details of what it means to manifest <em>chuunibyou</em> are left as an
exercise to the reader.</p>                </article>
