</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Thus far, I've categorized these blog posts as "news"&mdash;initially
I was doing more talk about politics this and that and stuff going on
in the (USA/national) news. Then, this blog has turned to more
narration and reflection mixed in with notes on stuff I've been trying
and learning. This blog has thus become a kind of diary/log (as the
title suggests) of my experience since around half a year ago when
"the normal routine" was shut down across the world, probably
beginning somewhere around Wuhan China. <sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I haven't written for some time&mdash;I don't want to write to just
contribute some <em>noise</em> to the world. As evidenced by the fact that
I'm not using Medium<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">2</a></sup> or some other more easily "social" blog/article
writing place you can see that the aim of this blog isn't to be
<em>popular</em>.</p>
<p>What I hope this blog to be is <strong>edifying</strong>. For me, it is a useful
tool to gather and present my thoughts on the things that are going on
around me and <em>keep me accountable for the choices I make to write my
life story</em>. So, this blog is a kind of system of <strong>accountability</strong>
for me. Am I causing needless trouble? Engaging in idle or vain talk?
The goal is that the answer to these questions is <em>"no!"</em></p>
<p>I encourage you to <em>stop</em> reading this and do what you need to do if
you aren't finding the words written here useful to you. My goal is to
<em>not waste your time</em> but to help you use it better, sharing my
experiences so you can avoid mistakes I've made.</p>
<h2>Grammar, Memory, Work</h2>
<p>I've been starting to do in-depth study of a few European languages.
Firstly, I'm studying Russian now, which involves learning a lot of
new grammar (e.g. memorizing noun declensions) and unfamiliar
vocabulary. I've learned the basic pronunciation of (modern) Greek to
be able to say and remember Greek words as I encounter them and I've
started to learn Latin as a way to understand the <strong>language arts</strong>
more broadly. <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I think that language study broadly fits under the category of
"wholesome activities"&mdash;activities that are good (or at least not
harmful) to the soul. So while not working on something I have to take
care of (e.g. day job to make enough money to live off of, logistics),
I'm trying to make good use of my time.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/index.html">Language and
Linguistics</a>
website continues to be slowly built up.</p>
