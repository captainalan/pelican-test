</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>There is this slang term <strong>butthurt</strong> to describe someone who responds
very poorly to any criticism or joking. We should strive to <em>never be
butthurt</em>, but instead take criticisms&mdash;whatever people/parties
they come from&mdash;as opportunities to gain understanding of our own
shortcomings and errors so that we can improve.</p>
<h2>There are many ways in which I have been "butthurt"</h2>
<p>I am writing about what it means to be "butthurt" because I myself
have experienced this cringeworthy state. Here are some scenarios in
which I felt butthurt,</p>
<ul>
<li>I seek attention, but get none</li>
<li>My <em>effort</em> isn't rewarded (because I did not produce a useful
  result)</li>
<li>I focus too much on things I have done (pride) rather than looking
  for where I could work to improve</li>
</ul>
<p>The third point here is especially pertinent to nerds. Many nerds will
do something like... neglect refinement of the body. They will think
themselves "brainy" people that are in some sense superior to their
less abstraction inclined neighbors.</p>
<h2>Criticism is helpful</h2>
<p>Criticism is a vehicle by which we can identify where we are "coping"
or "making excuses". Especially valuable is criticism from people that
are more knowledgable than us and remarks from "third parties" (e.g. a
stranger yells something at you). <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>When faced with criticism, we should assume that the person making
this criticism notices something <em>true</em> and examine ourselves to see
how they are right. For instance, if someone says to me "you look
sloppy" in some form or another, this is an helpful reminder for me to
look at my habits and identify ways in which I am being careless and
lazy, where instead I should be vigilant and industrious.</p>
<h2>"But that's just the way I am"</h2>
<p>To say "but that's just the way I am" is often a way to <em>remain
butthurt</em>. The idea is this: some flaw of character is cast off as
some <em>aspect of immutable personality</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I am not saying that different people don't have different
dispositions or personalities. Every human is unique and we can group
people in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Rather, the point to be emphasized here is that it is of utmost
importants to not adopt a kind of <strong>fatalistic</strong> attittude when we are
dealing with things that are <em>within our control</em>. The mindsets we
assume and how we relate to others are things unlike the weather,
politics, and what your native language are in that we can active
choices to be changed <em>now</em> with respect to these.</p>
