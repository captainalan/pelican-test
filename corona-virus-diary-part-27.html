</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>On my morning walk I see the replacing of "WEAR A MASK" signs/banners
with new content. Narratives are swapped like pairs of sneakers.</p>
<p>Talk of "COVID-19" is rapidly replaced by other impending
matters&mdash;in Sacramento, California with looting and rioting
nearby by suburb (though relatively peaceful, compared with other
cities) the new reason to stay inside is because of "curfew" rather
than airborn viruses.</p>
<p>Recently, I got a letter in the mail from the IRS. This letter turned
out to be announcing the $1200 relief/aid money that came a couple
weeks earlier. A little white collar scare for me&mdash;glad there was
no issue to deal with&mdash;I paid muh taxes and stuff...</p>
<h2>Permission to Live</h2>
<p>Many peaceful channels by which people might normally deal with
frustration/anger are unavailable (if you would like to follow the
law, at least). Having friends over for dinner, taking a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1412317-doomer">night
walk</a>, and anonymously
loitering at a coffee shop are all off limits. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In place of everyday activities that help us learn about and connect
with the people around us, we have doom-and-gloom news piped directly
from to smartphone and brain&mdash;</p>
<p>And now, there are <strong>shibboleths</strong> being used left-and-right to sort
out in-group loyalties. <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Urged to "speak out", many people feel compelled to announce stances
on issues&mdash;to say nothing is to be complicit in the badness?</p>
<p>I still have no idea what is going on in Syria, or Ukraine, or
Jamaica, or tons and tons of other places in the world. These places
are foreign to me; they are not in my backyard. Are there systemic
injustices in these places? Probably, I assume. Perhaps they have
political opinions about Asian-Americans living in Sacramento, CA.</p>
<h2>Good Guys/Bad Guys</h2>
<p>In the United States, angst, anger, sadness, and frustration is
everywhere (particularly concentrated in urban areas where people are
exposed to more news and smartphones). Agitated cries for <em>change</em>
erupt&mdash;what exactly should be done? A proletariat uprising?</p>
<p>On this matter, America is far from united; things are getting
<em>political</em> in the sense that force is being used in many directions.</p>
