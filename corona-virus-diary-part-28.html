</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today at work, I found that even my software documentation had
political messaging featured front and center. I retreat to my ivory
tower.</p>
<p>Now is a time to study, to work, to write... ...to pray. </p>
<p>Yesterday, I didn't post my blog to social media. Today, I don't think
I will post my blog to social media either. I think there are lots
more useful things to read for my blog for other people&mdash;I'll
keep on writing this here because I think it is useful for me to do,
but I don't feel an urge to push it out into "the public space" as
at this time our public spaces are thoroughly advertisement infested
with charismatic campaigns I can't hope to compete with.</p>
<h2>Civilizations need libraries</h2>
<p>Sometimes I'll complain about technology, but at the end of the day,
I'm not anti-technology. I'm thankful for many of the nice things we
have that make lots of tasks easier. The trick is to make technology
<em>work for you</em>, not the other way around. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>Disconnect: a heuristic</h3>
<p>One easy way to make sure technology is being useful to you (a tool to
allow you to do stuff more efficiently) is to disconnect as much of it
as you can from places where announcements/advertisements are pushed.</p>
<p>Truely, for most software, we don't need the "latest and greatest"
software&mdash;stuff written 10 years or more ago can often do the
trick. For example you might have applications to do the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>Write documents (e.g. Libreoffice Writer, markdown, LaTeX)</li>
<li>Calculator/number crunching (e.g. spreadsheets, R for statistics)</li>
<li>Media player (e.g. mpv, VLC)</li>
<li>pdf reader</li>
<li>Image editing</li>
<li>Programing languages and tools; editors, interpreters, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Above, I listed mostly open source or free software things because
these can be downloaded and used without forced updates. Getting some
mainstream Linux distribution&mdash;such as Ubuntu&mdash;will give you
most of these things readily. For more specialized tasks, you may have
to go download stuff.</p>
<p>MacOS does a decent job giving you alot of useful things right out of
the box (as well as some extra specialty things, like Garage Band for
music making).</p>
<p>Having an adequate pile of software such that <em>your computer/laptop
will still be useful to you while offline</em> is an effective heuristic
to make sure your technology is yours to command.</p>
<h3>Going on the Internet sometimes</h3>
<p>With the above things prepared, you can go online and grab a bunch of
stuff to enjoy/study/etc. offline.</p>
<p>I don't use Spotify or similar streaming services (though I often play
music on YouTube). I think that
<a href="https://youtube-dl.org/"><code>youtube-dl</code></a> is a helpful tool for
downloading media to (re)play later for as well as for archiving
purposes. Many old books and other documents are freely available
(e.g. as PDF files through <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project
Gutenberg</a>).</p>
<p>Without the distractions of notifications everywhere, windows open to
social media, etc., you can more easily use your computing time
efficiently and get off without spending more time than you think is
appropriate. Free up time to tidy up your living space, get exercise,
catch up with people that are important to you...</p>
<h2>Networks of people and things</h2>
<p>Using chat or messenging apps often doesn't require looking at some
news feed (where ads and stuff are likely to appear). For instance,
there is https://www.messenger.com/ for Facebook messenger. Using a
dedicated messenging app (either on a phone or on the dekstop site)
may be preferable to using the more "full-featured" Facebook app or
Facebook website.</p>
<p>Consider how SMS messages and phone calls typically just... allow
people to communicate. Hopefully you don't encounter too much ads/spam
in these places.</p>
<p>We can try to keep our communication channels clear of
<strong>noise</strong>&mdash;stuff that isn't the conversations we're trying to
have.</p>
<p>Similarly, shopping and other online activities can be done
purposefully. Keeping an old-fashioned shopping list (whether on some
text document on the computer or with pen/paper) and then buying stuff
from physical stores or the Internet is an effective way to prevent
impulse buying on the Internet. Furthermore, maintaining lists of
things you <em>may be interested in buying later</em> is a good way to shield
from spending money you don't have to buy things you don't need. By
writing down stuff you <em>may</em> want to buy later, you get the
satisfaction of documenting something you might not want to forget;
but also, you add a layer of protection against impulsiveness.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Here I outline some techniques anybody can use <em>with</em> mainstream
computing platforms, networks, and services for doing work, talking to
people and buying stuff that will also help you protect oneself
against media manipulation&mdash;to which <em>nobody is immune</em>.</p>
<p>By organizing our technology usage with efficiency in mind&mdash;and
giving ourselves options to work offline&mdash;we can save our time
and attention from the campaigns of third parties. This way, we can
spend our resources on things that we <em>more actively</em> decide our
important to us, rather than being responsive/reactionary consumers.</p>
