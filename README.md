# Getting Started with Pelican (Static Site Generator)

See this site deployed on [GitHub
Pages](https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/).

## Setting up

시작이 빈이다  
"Starting is half the battle"

### Pre-requisites

All instructions below assume you are working with WSL under Windows.
Similar steps probably work on all UNIX based systems, including MacOS.

I will assume basic working knowledge of Python, Markdown, HTML/CSS and client
side JavaScript.

### Installing things

You need a working installation of Python (3) and `pip` to use Pelican.

To get GitHub Pages to work, you need to install `ghp-import`.
Then, just run `make github`.
