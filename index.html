</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>What needs to be said? Anybody who has put forth great effort to try and change
themselves (or somebody else) will know that "talk is cheap"&mdash;while wise
words will help someone who has already decided to turn away from their old
mistaken ways, speaking much is wasted effort on someone who has decided to not
listen. In fact, saying more may have the opposite effect&mdash;we call this
<em>nagging</em> or <em>pestering</em> people.</p>
<p>A lot of marketing/"communication" training these days goes against this idea.
Rather than simply <em>giving people what they ask for</em> (e.g. you give a loaf of
bread to someone who can see/smell that the bread is good), we learn techniques
for telling people that they "need" things that they don't need or engineer
desires/wants within people.</p>
<p>I used to get excited about a lot of products and technologies. I was
interested in how I might "improve the world" by developing something new and
exciting. The longer I've studied technology, however, the more I've come to
the conclusion that there really isn't much for me to do in the area of
<strong>research</strong> (I was a graduate student). We already have all the tools we need
to "solve" the problems of the world. It is not a lack of technology, but
rather a lack of wisdom in how to use the tools/materials/etc that we already
have which prevent us from living what is called the <strong>Blessed life</strong> in the
Psalms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blessed <em>is</em> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
(Psalm 1:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we misdirect our thoughts and use what we've been given to chase vain
desires, we labor in futility.</p>                </article>
