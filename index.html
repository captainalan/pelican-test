</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Doing anything has <em>costs</em> because our time is not infinite. There are
many sayings out there about how you "can't buy more time"&mdash;yet
often we go through great lengths to <em>save money</em> even if this means
using up a lot of time.</p>
<p>The Internet has brought this sort of thinking to great scale. Many
people like to play "free games", even if these games will have ads,
spam/robots, and other undesirable elements of gameplay. If you are
going to spend dozens of hours a month playing a game (or more?) why
would you endure such things?</p>
<h2>What value do you attach to your own time?</h2>
<p>Growing up, it can seem like <em>time is plentiful</em> but other things,
like money, is what is most short. So we treat our time cheaply and
try to maximize things like... saving dollars. Of course saving and
investing now can pay off a lot later&mdash;I don't think we should
recklessly <em>consume</em>. However, it is important to not only make our
time "work for us" (in investments, including buying tools for the
work we do) but also to value our time.</p>
<p>What sort of activities are simply not worth your time?</p>
<h2>"Entertainment"</h2>
<p>Suppose you work a job, 9 AM to 5 PM, 5 days a week. If you wanted to
accomplish some other goal, such as learning another language, when
would you do this? Many people recommend doing difficult things first
thing in the morning. So, suppose you study Spanish from 7:30 to 8:30
then commute to work on weekdays. Chances are that as time goes on you
will become increasingly proficient at Spanish, provided you have some
at least halfway decent study materials.</p>
<p>Other activities you might choose to do in the morning may be
<em>counterproductive</em>. For example, eating the wrong sort of breakfast
may make you feel sluggish and therefore become unproductive during
the workday. Engaging in unhelpful conversations, looking at things
that give you distracting thoughts (e.g. scrolling through Instagram
and getting ads targeted at you that get you thinking about various
products throughout the day), etc may set you up for a wasted day.</p>
<p>Upon arriving home, what do you do? For people with families the many
accompanying responsiblities, problems often present themselves. Young
working professionals and other "independent actors" have more
choices.</p>
<p>Many advertisements will try to give you the message "you deserve XYZ"
and try to convince you to introduce something into your life as a
kind of reward. More careful consideration and good advice can let you
know if you are actually hurting yourself through escapism...</p>                </article>
