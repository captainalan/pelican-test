</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>In the season of COVID-19, many people are struggling with "keeping
occupied" or fighting boredom.</p>
<p>Taking a look back at bygone eras in faraway lands, we can study
activities that people <em>spent a lot of time on</em> for some guidance on
how to handle these difficult times.</p>
<p>In short, I will argue that idle time is well-spent in <em>memorizing
things</em>, whether this is technical/know-how things or cultural stuff
(e.g. a musical piece, scriptures/texts). By training our attention to
reproduce patterns of value we can find "internal stimulus"
(i.e. <em>motivation</em>) to act with purpose wherever we happen to find
ourselves.</p>
<h2>The "Work/Life Balance" Concept</h2>
<p>In the Western paid-by-the-hour or salaried systems of working, many
of us have a fairly distinguished "on/off the job" mentality such that
we get ideas like <em>seeking a <strong>work/life balance</strong></em>. <sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> It seems
that for most people, most of the time, such a strong distinction did
not exist; indeed people lived without clocks and stressful time
keeping for most of history. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>Events other than mechanical hands pointing to integers set the rhythm
of life. For instance, farmers worked according to seasons; craftsmen
had clear objectives of what they were doing&mdash;this was their
trade. In Ecclesiastes, we read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under
the heaven:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ecclesiastes 3:1 (KJV)</p>
<p>"Time management" was not a problem that most people faced because
they either faced coercion (people telling them what to do) or
necessities for survival were evident enough. There may be "local
boredom" within doing some monotonous task, but the "tyranny of
choice" was less apparent because there were other forms of tyranny to
be reckoned with.</p>
<p>The season of COVID-19 is challenging for many people because, among
other reasons, external stimuli signalling time intervals for
this-and-that are absent. While schools would have bells and clocks
and short periods of time to shuffle between classes, such structures
are absent in most people's remote setups. <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">3</a></sup></p>
<h3>Times of Waiting: The "Four Arts"</h3>
<p>We have ample examples of people enjoying leisure time as well as
filling in long hours during periods. Today, I'll be talking about
Chinese aristocrats who had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_arts">four favorite
activities</a>: 琴棋书画 <em>qín qí
shū huà</em> "musical instruments, chess, calligraphy, and painting". <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">4</a></sup></p>
<p>One common thread among all of these activities is that they were all
<em>culturally valued</em> and that they <em>indirectly trained abilities useful
elsewhere</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>qín</em> "musical instrument" refers to a stringed instrument,
typically played as a solo instrument. The Chinese word for <em>piano</em>
uses this same character: 钢琴 <em>gāngqín</em>&mdash;in many ways the
Western classical music tradition jives well with Chinese interest in
mastering dealing with instrumental complexity (often as a soloist).
As with any other instrument (but particularly instruments used as
"solo instruments"), playing <em>qín</em> required lots of practice and
study; memorizing a piece and then executing it well requires training
both hands and ears through many hours of concentrated practice.</p>
<p>Similar remarks may be made for chess playing. Good chess players do
not just play once or twice when they are bored&mdash;they remember
what did and didn't work from previous games they have played (and so
good players will play <em>a lot</em> of games). Nowadays, anybody who wants
to get serious at a strategy game of any sort (including online video
games) will have to memorize certain "openings" (including "item
builds" etc. in video games).</p>
<p>Calligraphy is not just about reproducing words, but reproducing words
<em>in a particular way</em>. To do calligraphy is to engage cultural
tradition, not just to make stuff "look pretty" or to go for "pure
functionality" (as some nerds may be predisposed to try). To do
calligraphy necessarily means looking beyond one's own likes and
engaging a literary heritage.</p>
<p>Finally there is painting; painting requires training find observation
skills and finding the "essence" of things&mdash;Chinese brush
painting also takes an exceptional amount of dexterity because there
is no easy "undo" button for ink committed to paper. Speed of
execution is important to capture a bird flying away...</p>
<p>A bored Chinese aristocrat would be better advised to engage seriously
in one of these activities rather than giving into vices like
drunkedness or disturbing the Confucian peace. When one grew weary of
any one of these, they knew of another art to pursue... While one
might specialize or have a favorite among the arts, learning to
appreciate all four of these can easily fill a lifetime.</p>
<h3>Modern Times</h3>
<p>Nowadays, we'll call the modern equivalents of many of the
aforementioned activities "entertainment" or "hobbies"&mdash;if they
happen to be prestigious or practical, we might call them "education"
or "training". <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">5</a></sup></p>
<p>We still have musical instruments; that connection is plain to see.
There are more applications for <em>qí</em> "strategy games"; for instance
one may regard computer programing as a kind of battle against a
compiler/interpreter. I think that many video games&mdash;insofar as
they are appreciated by society&mdash;are similar to <em>qín</em> and <em>qí</em> in
that they demand dexterity of the fingers as well as a strategic mind
to well. Most of us come from different traditions than Chinese
aristocrats, however we all have culturally important things to
copy, memorize and reproduce; we likewise have documents to compose.</p>
<p>Here, exercising the "blog format" I may regard myself as a modern
practitioner of a kind of <em>shū</em> "calligraphy". There is a small
technical element here (setting up a website, typing, etc.) comparable
to understanding the fundamental technical requirements of doing
calligraphy. Much of the challenge, however, comes from words and
meanings not the form alone.</p>
<p>With regards to <em>huà</em> "painting", there are many, many avenues these
days for expression in the graphic arts. On the one hand, we have
traditional painting, street sketching, photography, etc. to reproduce
what we already see in reality. Then, we have 3D modelling, digital
painting, etc. to create new images the world has yet to see.</p>
<h2>Time and Memory</h2>
<p>Each of the "Four Arts" involves devoting lots of time and energy to
memorization of some sort. To be able to do something reflectively,
without slow deliberation, we must be trained in <em>how to arrive at
that information quickly</em>; most quickly is through our minds. <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">6</a></sup> The
artist that is pushing to improve in their arts is not bored because
they have skills to train, topics to research, and performances to
give.</p>
<p>In this era of information overload, I think much of our challenge as
modern people is to select among many options and choose a managable
number of things that we want to obtain advanced proficiency
in. Nobody has time to be good at everything, but developing strong
skills in a handful of activities is a great way to both (1) dispell
boredom, and (2) become more effective at acting in "the real world"
outside of that activity.</p>
<p>Developing these skills involves remembering patterns, and memorizing
stuff takes time. However, when we have more things memorized, we are
<em>always free to think and create</em> regardless if our smartphones are
plugged in. We can spontaneously enjoy one another's company <em>without
worrying about whether such-and-such playlist will load and if there
will be ads</em>. We are free from privacy concerns because we are not
entering things into Google's search engine through Microsoft's
operating systems.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. How Chinese aristocrats beat boredom <em>and</em> big
brother. Amazing!</p>
