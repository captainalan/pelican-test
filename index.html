</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>In today's blog post, I'm just going to ramble loosely around the
theme of "abstractions and reality". Gotta keep up momentum writing
stuff, even if some pieces are much better than others...</p>
<h2>Getting humans into outer space</h2>
<p>Today SpaceX didn't get to launch a manned spacecraft into orbit
because the weather conditions didn't permit it. Conditions for
safe/successful flight were not met, so this launch was held off.</p>
<p>Stuff like <em>the weather</em> will always be with us; water, wind, sunlight
etc.&mdash;sometimes, from our cities with climate control we can
largely abstract these things away and turn our attention to other
education, entertainment, and everything in between.</p>
<p>However, when faced with a <em>very physically challenging task</em>, like
getting humans into space&mdash;well we must answer reality again. We
can control the weather in our living spaces to a large degree, but
we can't climate control the entire observable universe.</p>
<h2>Policy, Software, Law...</h2>
<p>Much of the order imposed on the world is through human "layers of
abstraction". If you learn a lot about how some policy works, some
software application works, or some law works, you learn about a
particular <em>human-created configuration</em> for things, which is
different from learning about the weather or biology.</p>
<p>Placed on a desert island and forced to survive with only a hatchet or
something... what help does knowledge of California law, Photoshop, or
your health insurance policy provide you? Insofar as these things
help; you recognize useful categories in the world and train skills in
reckoning with reality, they are useful. Beyond that, they are
<em>locally valuable</em> (only) in the sense that they can help you in a
particular time and place because people have decided to place value
on them, but this scope of worth does not extend to the metaphorical
desert island.</p>
<p>The computer programer without a computer may have some skills to
systematize operations and get things up and running efficiently. But
this person's specialized skills in keyboarding, hardware
this-and-that esoteric knowledge, idiosyncratic know-how about
such-and-such programing language or library&mdash;these things are
taken away.</p>
<p>However, skills in something abstract/fuzzy like "critical thinking"
or "problem solving" need concrete applications to be trained. This is
an (obvious?) reason why it isn't stupid to acquire a lot of
specialized knowledge, because it is in succeeding in some domain
(even human-created) that we train a more general fitness. </p>
<h2>California continues opening up</h2>
<p>The Season of COVID-19 has brought in a new "local scope" of altered
social norms. Health care workers got a boost in prestige. "Conspiracy
thinking" got extra-demonized as media companies (including primarily
Internet-based ones) chose dug into their ideological/geopolitical
trenches. Some relatively introverted people have been having a really
great time while some tortured extroverts have turned to committing
misdemeanors to keep themselves from punching holes in walls. </p>
<p>Through all of this, I see the "reality" (or <em>biology</em>) of the whole
COVID-19 situation is still far from clear/resolved.</p>
<p>Among other reasons, this is why I have focused by blog here I'm what
I'm thinking, pscyhologizing, and speculating versus trying to tell
you all <em>the facts</em> about what is going on. I still think we don't
know much; though, I think that many of the ideas I've been writing
about here have been useful to me navigating these difficult times.</p>                </article>
