</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>A quick Internet search (c.f. <em>Google</em> search) will reveal troves of
anti-Facebook articles. Should you get off Facebook?</p>
<p>I have not quit Facebook. Here's some reasons why:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using an online platform transparently linked to your real-world
   offers many advantages over anonymous platforms for <strong>connecting
   with real-life friends and family, commerce, and finding new
   communities</strong></li>
<li>Facebook will harvest data on you (you "node" in its graph) whether
   you like it or not; might as well <strong>take as much control</strong> of your
   user profile as you can</li>
<li>You can <strong>train Facebook</strong> to be more useful to you: e.g. use
   Facebook to study a foreign language</li>
<li>Understanding Facebook is a <strong>marketable skill</strong>: particularly,
   managing ad campaigns, administering pages, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>For those that can manage not being totally addicted to Facebook, I
think it is a decently good idea to reclaim Facebook as <em>your public
facing platform</em>. Facebook is now a rather established platform that
offers many useful services. Approaching Facebook purposefully, you
can leverage it to be an overall good thing in your life.</p>
<h2>Don't be a coward, show your face!</h2>
<p>There are many places on the Internet where users communicate with
(relative) anonymity, hiding behind an anime profile picture, an image
of a cute dog/cat, some meme character, etc.  Certainly, there are
cases where anonymity is useful, notably for <strong>whistleblowers</strong> or
other individuals who <em>must</em> be anonymous for their own safety.  I
support the creation and maintenance of places for people to
communicate anonymously (and oppose "deplatforming" in the USA where I
live, generally), but I don't think they are good for most people most
of the time.</p>
<p>Here are some general points about how anonymity can lead to bad
behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little to no "<strong>skin in the game</strong>" causes people to speak
  recklessly or to take actions that can hurt others</li>
<li><strong>Escapism</strong> is encouraged; <strong>accountability</strong> is avoided</li>
<li><strong>Trends</strong> are more difficult to assess; prolific shit-posters may
  inflate the relevance of certain themes, bringing the fringe to the
  mainstream; different information ecosystems</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, having a real-world identity linked up with online
interactions encourages people to treat each other more politely and
avoid being overtly nasty as the Internet functions as something of a
public record.</p>
<p>Using a real-world identity online encoruages people to use online
platforms as <em>a gateway to offline interactions</em>. Logistics can be
handled much more easily if everyone involved is familiar with social
media.</p>
<p>The question of ads and influence (what I like to call "the dark
arts") is a big topic, especially following all the 2016 presidential
election stuff. That being said, a platform like Facebook allows
astute users to observe who is pushing what agenda more
transparently. Ads have to be pushed by someone for something, after
all. </p>
<h2>Control your node</h2>
<p>I have spoken to friends who at some point or another decided to
"close" their Facebook accounts. To the best of my knowledge, Facebook
makes no promises at ever completely deleting your stuff, so closing
your account is essentially forfeiting control of your node (data representing you on Facebook's <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview">Graph API</a>.</p>
<p>Choosing to keep a Facebook account (even if you don't use it much) is
akin to holding onto property you'd rather have <em>not abused</em> event if
you aren't actively using it. Particularly for public-facing
individuals, keeping control of Facebook content about you might be a
good idea,</p>
<h2>Train Facebook to do what you want</h2>
<p>Facebook's <strong>Feed</strong> has been the subject of lots of controversy.  Many
things about it are opaque to end users. However, in general, a "what
you put into the surveillance state browser is what you get out of it"
principle seems to hold true for most people I have discussed these
issues with.</p>
<p>If you log into Google chrome and search for digital camera things on
Amazon, what sort of ads do you expect to see in Facebook?</p>
<p>You can train Facebook to give you more of what you think you <em>should
be seeing</em>. For example, if you are trying to do more home cooking,
just go search some cooking stuff. Facebook will probably feed you
lots of interesting inspiration.</p>
<h2>Purposefully use Facebook</h2>
<p>Nowadays, I only pick up phone calls if I am expecting a call or if
the number calling is one I recognize. This has saved lots of time.</p>
<p>Approaching Facebook with a <strong>policy</strong> like how many people approach
phone calls can allow you to leverage this powerful platform to
enhance your life. </p>                </article>
