&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;un-fun
blockers are a no go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I enjoy riding bicycles. But when I get flat tires, this
is &lt;em&gt;annoying&lt;/em&gt;. I often go run instead of bicycling so I don't have to
deal with problem that comes up every now and then and ruins my fun.
It is possible to restore fun by enjoying walking one's bike miles to
get back home, but then this to is because presuming that your &lt;em&gt;feet
work&lt;/em&gt;. If you got a flat tire &lt;em&gt;and then&lt;/em&gt; a sprained ankle, chances are
you wouldn't be having much fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology and Fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I think playing video games is more fun than office
work for lots of people is that a game a nice self-contained
environment (we'll assume it isn't buggy) with clearly defined goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple, easy to use things are more accessible fun. This is one reason
I think many "gamification" approaches are successful.  By simplifying
the complex nature of some situation into a space with well-defined
WIN/LOSE conditions, people are more likely to quickly achieve fun
than if they had to meticulously design these sytems themselves (the
managers/engineers who make these systems may have a lot of fun
designing these systems too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some Examples from Programing/Coding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding websites are a popular way for people to practice
writing computer code. Despite having fancy gaming PCs, high-end
macbooks, etc., people everywhere are parking themselves in little
browser tabs to sort items in arrays and run their programs on
external/remote servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of these self-contained web-based environments, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://leetcode.com/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;https://codepen.io/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1"&gt;A Tour of Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that popularity of sites like these is due to easy
accessibility and gamification systems that give people positive
feedback. The "modern UIs" of these sites allow users to focus on one
task (e.g. writing code) ignoring the many layers and layers of
abstraction piled on top of each other to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I haven't used these sites much at all, but I do enjoy
setting up a minimalistic text editing environment using dinosaur
software (e.g. emacs, bash). Doing data structure/algorithm problems
is fun to me because I can stay in my little contained stripped down
editor environment and not worry about importing this-and-that
library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some Examples from Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many bloggers choose to use some flavor of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; to do their
work. It turns out that writing everything in plain text is often
faster/easier to do than using a more "full-featured" word processor
such as Microsoft Word. This is because you can focus on the
words/content of what you are doing rather than get distracted/blocked
by the many features of a word processor you will not use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people that write computer code of any sort, familiar editing
tools may allow you to use your own keybindings and stuff to work much
more seemlessly with text than using a word processor. It can almost
feel like "telepathy", magically making words appear when you are a
skilled typist in a comfy editor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tools to be mastered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some programs are more useful than others. Having hundreds of
different hard-to-use, unmemorable programs scattered throughout a
computer will probably mean... using a computer isn't fun. Or, you
might just ignore all those programs and just play a game. A
full-screen game effectively allows you to ignore you messy desktop,
dozens of unread browser tabs, etc., and focus on fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing just which programs are useful to you and keeping those
applications "well-maintained" is a good way to have fun using
computers.  It is more fun to go out on a bike ride if you know your
bicycle has properly inflated tires, an oiled chain, working lights
for the night, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when I sit down at the computer, I am happy knowing I am
able to do a handful of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsers for communications, reading, documentation, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image editing software to produce content&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Krita for digital painting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MS Paint for maximum fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GIMP for generic image editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environment to write computer code (mostly JavaScript) set up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogging tools (emacs + bash, command line interaction to update to
  GitHub pages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and then many tools I intend to learn to use better eventually,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blender (3D modeling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various programing languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games, if I do get around to playing them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is crucial is that all of these things are ready to be launched
and used and that I know the steps to "get back into the flow of
things".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up for success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is some activity you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing, then it makes sense
to set up your environment so that your technology will not get in the
way when you are trying to that activity. Then, you can start having
fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, technology ruins fun by being too complicated. For these
reasons, to get into a habit such as "doing some artwork everyday", it
might be wise to ditch photoshop and instead use Paint (or an
&lt;a href="https://jspaint.app/"&gt;in-browser equivalent&lt;/a&gt;. You can revisit the
fancier software when you know clearly &lt;em&gt;why you need it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, to begin doing something like &lt;em&gt;exercising more&lt;/em&gt; it may be
best to just start doing some easy to access exercise daily,
e.g. walking while listening to some podcast. Soon enough, this will
seem to easy (and perhaps not so "fun" as it is too relaxing) and you
can scale up the intensity of whatever you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, it pays to have fun:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to enjoy life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to have a sustainable lifestyle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to spread joy to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[...]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; shouldn't need a justification. So more fun and
equal/more productivity is better, all things considered. kk have fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Fun"></category></entry><entry><title>Shadowrun Games Review</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/shadowrun-games-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-28T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-28T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-28:/pelican-test/shadowrun-games-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is my game review for &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/346940/Shadowrun_Hong_Kong__Extended_Edition/"&gt;Shadowrun: Hong

&lt;p&gt;This review &lt;em&gt;contains no spoilers&lt;/em&gt;. I'm mainly discussing major
gameplay things you'll be able see within ten minutes of playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you trust someone who doesn't drink coffee to give you reviews
of the local cafés? Probably not. Let me tell you a bit about myself
and my gaming history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I am a Casual&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't play games competitively whatsoever. I briefly tried to climb
in LoL, but I sucked and remained in Bronze where I originally placed,
lol. I am a &lt;em&gt;casual&lt;/em&gt;. So here I am, reviewing a game series I played
through on &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; mode. Me, a &lt;strong&gt;normie&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I take a long time to play through games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, when I go through some game, I play like 3-7 times per a
week in around 1-2 hour sessions. That being said, it takes a while
for me to finish playing through any game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Races, Classes, Etiquettes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting aspect of the Shadowrun games is the way characters
are built. Building interesting characters is one the main reasons
people would play an
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Races&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software"&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt;"
humans and then there are "metahumans": trolls, orcs, dwarves, elves.
Using different (fictional) races like this allows the game creators
to introduce low-key "&lt;strong&gt;race realism&lt;/strong&gt;" into this game. Some races are
more/less charismatic than others, other races are physically
stronger/weaker. These discussions needn't be &lt;em&gt;hateful&lt;/em&gt; of course;
rather the player must ask themselves, how do I navigate this
diversity that I never asked for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as with other fictional universes, you can safely explore the
notion of "race" in Shadowrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Classes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate, I typically received the same sort of reaction
when I said I was majoring in Philosophy (and Chinese, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
"Chinese Philosophy" mind you). Namely, people asked "wtf are you
gonna do with that?" A valid question, ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadowrun is similar&amp;mdash;except you choose a general &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; for
your character, and typically build up attributes/abilities (by
spending &lt;em&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt; points) that match your character's affinities. As in
real life, your resources are limited, so if you try to spread your
development too thin (like yours truly), you may quickly end up the
"jack of all trades, but the master of none". However, as you hyper
focus, there are also &lt;strong&gt;diminishing marginal returns&lt;/strong&gt;, with each
increasing of an existing ability/attribute you have being more
expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus to build a strong character (in terms of game mechanics), you
have to strike a balance between spcializing (and unlocking very
powerful abilities) and building yourself a broad palette of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Etiquettes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Shadowrun, you choose an "etiquette", like Corporate, Security,
Gang... Basically this is social know-how for some type of community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this pretty relevant to real life; you may, for example, be a
straight-A student, but a total idiot on the streets. Likewise, you
may be excellent at writing cover letters for LinkedIn, but you may
suck at creating cheery conversation buzz with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building a character, you can optionally get cyber-body upgrades
like plastic coating for your skin and such. Each upgrade consumes
"essence" of your body; you cannot completely replace yourself with
robo-parts! For you nerds that like "deep thoughts", check out some
thought experiments in "&lt;strong&gt;Philosophy of Mind&lt;/strong&gt;". You can sip wine with
your pinky up while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The cyberpunk aesthetic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason I can see for playing Shadowrun is to enjoy immersive
role playing. For tactical strategy greatness, fast-paced action,
studying Japanese, or whatever you might wanna do, there are probably
better options. But for running around sprawling urban concrete
jungles causing mischief, these games are pretty fun. Would recommend
and play again!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Fun"></category></entry><entry><title>Tactile Niceness: From Computer Keyboards to Musical Instruments</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/tactile-niceness-from-computer-keyboards-to-musical-instruments.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-17T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-17T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-17:/pelican-test/tactile-niceness-from-computer-keyboards-to-musical-instruments.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Why Dvorak, When Dvořák&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musical instruments, stringed ones in particular have many features of
a good ergonomic keyboard layout. Since spending some more time
studying music more seriously, I've lost interest in optimizing
typing. I used to type Dvorak (got over 100 WPM), but have since
switched &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; to standard QWERTY, the default of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the (physical) input of what you are doing is reflected in the
(physical) output, it feels good. Computer keyboards will always be
characterized by arbitrariness because there is a lot of chaos in
writtelanguage. Even if by chance a keyboard was designed where the
arrangement of letters somehow matched some phonetic properties or
something like that, this wouldn't necessarily translate to a nice
typing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing stringed instruments is tactically satisfying because the
inputs you apply (bowing, picking, etc.) translate immediately into
the sounds produced. Even looking at different ways of tuning a guitar
(e.g. standard EADGBE versus DADGAD), the "logic" of fretting to get
higher pitched sounds remains. The layout of the instrument (and
therefore the "inputs" it takes) will always be reflected in the
sounds produced. Keyboard instruments typically do this, but I guess
you could program a synthesizer to behave more arbitrarily if you
really wanted to... but why? Just type to experience that chaos!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Fun"></category></entry><entry><title>HEHEHEHEHE</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/hehehehehe.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-15T10:50:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-15T10:50:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-05-15:/pelican-test/hehehehehe.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is a pleasure to edit in Markdown!&lt;/p&gt;
