&lt;p&gt;Musical instruments, stringed ones in particular have many features of
a good ergonomic keyboard layout. Since spending some more time
studying music more seriously, I've lost interest in optimizing
typing. I used to type Dvorak (got over 100 WPM), but have since
switched &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; to standard QWERTY, the default of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the (physical) input of what you are doing is reflected in the
(physical) output, it feels good. Computer keyboards will always be
characterized by arbitrariness because there is a lot of chaos in
writtelanguage. Even if by chance a keyboard was designed where the
arrangement of letters somehow matched some phonetic properties or
something like that, this wouldn't necessarily translate to a nice
typing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing stringed instruments is tactically satisfying because the
inputs you apply (bowing, picking, etc.) translate immediately into
the sounds produced. Even looking at different ways of tuning a guitar
(e.g. standard EADGBE versus DADGAD), the "logic" of fretting to get
higher pitched sounds remains. The layout of the instrument (and
therefore the "inputs" it takes) will always be reflected in the
sounds produced. Keyboard instruments typically do this, but I guess
you could program a synthesizer to behave more arbitrarily if you
really wanted to... but why? Just type to experience that chaos!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Fun"></category></entry><entry><title>HEHEHEHEHE</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/hehehehehe.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-15T10:50:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-15T10:50:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-05-15:/pelican-test/hehehehehe.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is a pleasure to edit in Markdown!&lt;/p&gt;
