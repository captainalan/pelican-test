the right job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is available&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most modern people make frequent use of at least a few different tools to do
written communication. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e-mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;messaging apps (Messenger, LINE, WeChat etc)^[1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;websites (static)&amp;mdash;sites you go on to "look up information"; contrast
  this with a &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; website like Facebook which has constantly
  changing/updating content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;books and other print resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these tools have properties that make them well-suited for certain
jobs, but terrible fits for others. Through my experience being an Internet
nerd, I will share how to use and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;E-mail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic form of these things is pretty fixed for now. While Gmail and other
"modern" e-mail applications might introduce new (anti-)features like various
notification this-and-that, the basic functions of e-mail have now been
established for decades. The name &lt;strong&gt;e-mail&lt;/strong&gt; accurately expresses what it
is&amp;mdash;electronic (or &lt;em&gt;digital&lt;/em&gt;) mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-mail is good for longer-form, carefully written messsages. For instance, many
people will still go to e-mail first for the purposes of...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaching the author of a book/paper with a question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacting a company to inquire about job openings/offerings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking up on a friend/relative who doesn't use social media like Facebook,
  Instagram, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailing/documenting some situation or issue and sending a report to
  relevant parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like physical mail, dealing with e-mail often involves the issue of dealing
with some accumulating pile of &lt;em&gt;unread&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;unsorted&lt;/em&gt; messages. Before Gmail
became widespread, people also had to &lt;em&gt;delete&lt;/em&gt; messages to manage a finite
amount of storage space. Gmail made the idea of "archiving" mainstream&amp;mdash;
never deleting anything so Google, federal agents, and maybe you, can easily
search past messages for relevant information you won't "throw away" on
accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;archiving&lt;/em&gt; ability of e-mail makes it useful as a &lt;em&gt;log of
communications&lt;/em&gt;. So suppose you need to have some work done on your home.
E-mail communications provide a "paper trail" to make sure everything gets
taken care of, workers are fairly compensated, and so on and so forth.  Trying
to track these things through a messier chat log would be difficult.  Having
clearly written but thorough e-mail messages written with the intention of
being easily searchable and providing documentation beats an app like FB
Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-mail is thus &lt;em&gt;good for doing work&lt;/em&gt; that involves clear, intentional
communication. It discourages idle talk because you know that your chatter will
be more junk to sort through later. &lt;em&gt;You will annoy yourself later&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-mail is not so good for "pinging" people, multi-party (more than two people)
conversations or sending messages that require more than text and/or a couple
of images. Many people (myself included) don't constantly watch their e-mail
inboxes while working. You probably have better things to do than to stare at
your mailbox waiting for the postman&amp;mdash;unless you're a dog. So to reach
someone "instantly", a phone call, a message on a chatting app, etc may be a
more sure-fire way to establish contact. Or, of course, you can schedule a time
to call via e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threads with a lot of people are difficult and confusing to read&amp;mdash;not much
more to say on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the form of e-mails is limited by the medium. If you have to present
information in a very specific way (e.g. you have a gallery of photos to
share), then linking to a website &lt;em&gt;in an e-mail&lt;/em&gt; is preferable to a chain of 25
e-mails each with a giant &lt;code&gt;.jpeg&lt;/code&gt; attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Messaging Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messaging apps are useful for havin conversations in the "digital world". While
I think a lot can be said about how "face-to-face" or "in-person" conversations
are superior to online conversations, I think we can appreciate how in the
modern world most of us often have to interface with the &lt;strong&gt;digital veil&lt;/strong&gt; which
rests above "base reality".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like different physical places, different chatting platforms have different
properties. In 2021, &lt;strong&gt;Discord&lt;/strong&gt; is the de-facto "chat room" app for NEETs
awaiting government stimulus checks. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is a useful place to connect with
interest-centered communities&amp;mdash;e.g. computer programmers, digital artists,
and organic farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook messenger is a go-to place for "real life" contacts. Many people
around my age (millennial generation) understand that Faceboook "glows", but
this is acceptable for nearly all "normal/everyday" conversations. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Deciding where to meet a group of friends under surveillance cameras is already
being watched and recorded, so you might as well use the nice IT infrastructure
big tech provides to facilitate such a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people you see walking around, sitting on benches, etc with mobile devices
probably are using some chat app. &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A fact of 2021 is that lots of people do
much of their chatting online. So getting skilled/comfy in these platforms can
be helpful for getting stuff done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Websites (Static)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt; websites&amp;mdash;that is, websites that aren't
"social", fueled by ever-changing data contributed by users. You can think of a
static website like a print resource you can access via a phone, computer, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about useful information you might want to look up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recipes to cook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuals for machines, programming languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charts, reference books, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than having a ginormous (paper) library, having easily searchable
digital documents can be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their best, these resources are freely available, don't annoy you with
advertisements, and display nicely on a wide variety of devices (like desktop,
tablet, mobile).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Print Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print resources can't be changed by some central server and thus are a valuable
decentralized data store. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; are in charge of the security of these things.
You won't be "gaslit" by Big Brother so easily with these materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of this is convenience; oftentimes using paper resources may be a
slower, more complex process than using digital technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe in the long run, however, this is actually good. For instance, I learned
how to read/write lots of Chinese characters via the "old-fashioned" pen and
paper methods. I am not sure I could have learned what I have with only digital
resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, digital written communications are everywhere. Understanding various
properties of each common form of digital communication can be helpful for
avoiding useless "innovations" and making the most of existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If e-mail does something better, you gain no advantage having everyone in your
project switch to some new fancy chat service. Likewise, trying to smash
something that is better done via chatting to e-mail will make your inbox bleed
and lead to confusion. Some things need no "discussion"&amp;mdash;static webpages
&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; comments and stuff can be best for lots of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking first of the &lt;em&gt;work that needs to be done&lt;/em&gt; and then choosing the
appropriate tool is better than trying to use some one tool for 8 hours a day
(just because it is in some job description made by some HR person).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different nations seem to have their favorite "preferred" app. Likewise,
  there will be online communities centered around particular apps&amp;mdash;lots
  of privacy concerned people like &lt;strong&gt;Signal&lt;/strong&gt;. Neckbeards (&lt;em&gt;ackshual&lt;/em&gt; or in
  character) enjoy &lt;strong&gt;Discord&lt;/strong&gt;, Crypto enthusiasts like Telegram...&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not Employed, in Education, or Training&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Glows" refers to federal agents, government surveillance, etc.;
  Facebook/Messenger clearly isn't a "free" and "privacy-centric" platform.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't have a source. Go back to reddit, nerd!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

which provides analysis on lots of the ideas I started to explore here in this
blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes with timestamps follow,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;01:00&amp;mdash;introduction to "pop science" conception of this topic; people
  coming up with "Codes of Ethics" for AI ("Artificial Intelligence"); in order
  to do this right, you have to get more fundamental issues clarified. For
  instance, what are &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; (and what are systems we call AI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;05:10&amp;mdash;AI gets "personified"; "intelligence" viewed as the pinnacle of
  human existence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;06:10&amp;mdash;when do we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to replace humans? enhance humans? clearing a
  landmine is a good use-case for not using a human. but what about &lt;em&gt;enhancing&lt;/em&gt;
  humans? bias towards the "cognitive"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;07:10&amp;mdash;image of &lt;strong&gt;golem&lt;/strong&gt;; popular in 19th c w/ Frankenstein and stuff.
  It is a kind of &lt;em&gt;mirror;&lt;/em&gt; reflects our ideas of morality. Making people
  "better" usually means something like... adding power/capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;08:30&amp;mdash;"AI &lt;em&gt;dethroning&lt;/em&gt; humans"; anthropological issue of the place of
  humans relative to other things and creatures in the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;09:30&amp;mdash;What are humans being "dethroned" at? Obviously, we have machines
  that can travel faster than people, lift heavier objects, etc. Is winning at
  chess/go/etc similar?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:20&amp;mdash;"underdog/revolutionary" story dominant in the West. &lt;em&gt;Desire&lt;/em&gt; for
  AI takeover, alien takeover... cuckolding? Stories from Greeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11:30&amp;mdash;technical impossibility of "general intelligence"; beyond this
  issue is &lt;em&gt;what people believe is true&lt;/em&gt;. We don't even &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; if other people
  are conscious; how can we tell that machines are? We operate in the world
  with &lt;em&gt;assumptions&lt;/em&gt; about how stuff works. e.g. we assume people are more
  important than animals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13:50&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;idols&lt;/strong&gt; as the &lt;em&gt;creation of a body to host intelligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:40&amp;mdash;we &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; big tech in the same way the ancients trusted their
  gods; system set up so you are forced to interact with these entities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16:00&amp;mdash;some people &lt;em&gt;looking forward&lt;/em&gt; to "superintelligence", others
  afraid&amp;mdash;a &lt;strong&gt;false dichotomy&lt;/strong&gt; in that we're already in this system.
  Similar to in ancient times, through a &lt;strong&gt;"priestly caste"&lt;/strong&gt; the will of these
  things is explained to us. Nowadays, this caste includes tech elites.
  Superior in understanding? Do you want to entrust your fate to them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18:25&amp;mdash;analogy of "ethics of weapon making"; can you impose an ethical
  system on AI? or, just recognize moral implications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20:20&amp;mdash;the way we think about &lt;strong&gt;privacy&lt;/strong&gt; is shaped by how we use
  technology. Technology is changing the way in which we interact with each
  other &lt;em&gt;in its own image&lt;/em&gt;. There is a kind of parasitic relationship between
  info tech and people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21:30&amp;mdash;humans as "sex organs of the machine"; 22:30&amp;mdash; however, we
  should also recognize the agency of tech oligarchs in operating/directing the
  machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21:50&amp;mdash;without the Internet, social media, etc the whole COVID phenomena
  we are experiencing now wouldn't be possible. Lock-downs wouldn't be
  possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24:20&amp;mdash;"In reality, there was no lock-down. There were just middle class
  people hiding with working class people delivering stuff to them"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25:00&amp;mdash;digital interactions strip lots of things from
  interactions&amp;mdash;"body language", smells in the room, etc; we sense lots of
  things in places where we meet people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25:40&amp;mdash;social media as &lt;em&gt;entertainment brought to the person-to-person level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;26:30&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;electricity&lt;/strong&gt;, electricity going beyond our bodies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;27:00&amp;mdash;we can &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; people looking at us. Animals too have all sorts
  of ways of perceiving. Digital tech is extremely focusing/limiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;28:00&amp;mdash;digital interactions "clean up" interactions&amp;mdash;this makes me
  think too of how all these cartoon avatars/profiles and stuff are popular.
  People are trying to get rid of the "messiness" of interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29:10&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;attention&lt;/strong&gt; as the basis of reality; LIKE mechanism as a
  measure of attention. Quantifying attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30:20&amp;mdash;attending to a person is a very complex thing. LIKE as a
  "currency of attention" is rather crude in that all sorts of ways of paying
  attention can be reduced to the same thing&amp;mdash;all "likes" counted the
  same, regardless if some video/article/etc is &lt;em&gt;life-changing&lt;/em&gt; or just seen in
  passing. quantity &amp;gt; quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32:00&amp;mdash;the system itself ("turning attention into currency") limits the
  extent to which ethics can be applied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;33:40&amp;mdash;reducing intelligence to quantity, mechanizing this&amp;mdash;humans
  are treated like animals or machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;34:40&amp;mdash;FB and Twitter recognized you &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; people via attention. Setting
  up a "false god" they didn't yet realize the way to optimize attention
  grabbing is by appealing to the "&lt;strong&gt;lizard-brain&lt;/strong&gt;" (base passions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36:00&amp;mdash;intelligence comes from &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt;; human output is fed to
  machines. Horrendous jobs of &lt;strong&gt;content moderation&lt;/strong&gt;. Actual &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; doing
  the labor; it is false to say machines are doing this. Rather, poorly paid
  people are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;36:40&amp;mdash;human intelligence is "farmed" and fed to machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37:30&amp;mdash;Unlike the film &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, humans are being farmed for
  "intelligence" rather than body/heat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;38:00&amp;mdash;whole system is really "energy hungry"; rather than having
  endless leisure because machines do all the labor for us, what do we find?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;39:50&amp;mdash;Genie and the wish; people wanted something, but didn't think of
  the &lt;em&gt;side effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40:00&amp;mdash;"hate speech" detection. Can machines detect irony? Or all the
  people that inform the machine algorithms? Can you get rid of "bias" to begin
  with? Cultural issues!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;41:15&amp;mdash;social media itself &lt;em&gt;fuels&lt;/em&gt; the creation of "hate speech". People
  are trying to control a thing they themselves created. Anonymization,
  physical distance, and so on gives people more opportunity to unleash darker
  aspects of themselves. Efforts to control these problems (online) end up
  spilling out into "normal society". Things like "dogpiling" in comments
  sections don't occur so often in normal interactions. Unfair oustings also
  less common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43:45&amp;mdash;weird "appeal process". How can you appeal some action if you
  don't even know what you're being accused of? Opaque rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;44:50&amp;mdash;people working on problems of "hate speech" have certain
  assumptions; they don't seem to realize how these rules might be applied to
  them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;46:30&amp;mdash;contradiction. &lt;em&gt;Unification&lt;/em&gt; with the dominance of a particular
  sort of English. E-mail autocompletion. On the other hand we see
  &lt;em&gt;fragmentation&lt;/em&gt;, e.g. in the multiplication of different gender categories.
  Marginalized groups have their voices amplified so they appear as larger
  portions of society than they actually comprise. This in turn leads to more
  attention &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; these people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50:20&amp;mdash;weird upside down world "created" to combat "hate"; margin has to
  be &lt;em&gt;promoted&lt;/em&gt; in this inverted hierarchy. "Activists" boosted in this
  &lt;em&gt;attention economy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;52:00&amp;mdash;AI effectively boosts the power of the &lt;em&gt;leading players&lt;/em&gt;; e.g.
  &lt;em&gt;What appears on the first page of Google?&lt;/em&gt; people are fighting over this.
  Clearly there are &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; behind this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;52:50&amp;mdash;handwavy explanation of "Oh, it's the &lt;em&gt;algorithm&lt;/em&gt;"; we know this
  isn't true and that people bake their biases into things... Is there even
  such a thing as an "unbiased view of the world"?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;53:50&amp;mdash;problem isn't &lt;em&gt;getting rid of bias&lt;/em&gt;, but rather &lt;em&gt;imposing your
  bias&lt;/em&gt; on others. Refusing to acknowledge problems... imagining things are
  more "equal" when in fact there is just a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; hierarchy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;55:40&amp;mdash;are &lt;em&gt;emotions&lt;/em&gt; seen as the problem? ironic because the whole
  system is based on &lt;em&gt;manipulating&lt;/em&gt; emotions; AI are better because they don't
  have emotions, yet they exploit our emotions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;57:00&amp;mdash;relationship of tech companies to &lt;strong&gt;politics&lt;/strong&gt;. Tech company
  people are &lt;em&gt;unelected!&lt;/em&gt; This is compounded by lock downs where we're all
  forced to look at screens for a long time each day. A totalitarian system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;58:20&amp;mdash;we shouldn't despair. Some people have tried to set up
  alternatives (and then we see these got attacked); it seems control from big
  tech is extremely strong... 1:01:00&amp;mdash;but maybe people are getting ready
  to "let out". Studying AI technology can be like a &lt;em&gt;mirror&lt;/em&gt; reminding us to
  look at what we (people) are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:00:00&amp;mdash;taken for granted that private conversations are "shady"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:03:00&amp;mdash;lots of work on AI ethics stuff is "utilitarian" or
  "consequentialist"; definitions of intelligence like "being able to take
  steps to reach goals" (&lt;strong&gt;instrumentalist&lt;/strong&gt; type view). "Enlightenment" ideas
  of rationalism/reason, like Steven Pinker type stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:04:40&amp;mdash;but we can have &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; goals; understanding
  intelligence in terms of goals might be fine, but we have to consider what

terms for the "uninitiated". For example, we're often told about these
things called &lt;strong&gt;"algorithms"&lt;/strong&gt; that will replace jobs, protect
national security/privacy, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should frame these things in simpler, more transparent terms. All
an "algorithm" is is a set of instructions for computers. When we talk
about "losing jobs to AI", this means &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; choosing to take humans
out of processes and replace them with machines and then letting
machines handle decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of having a receptionist, a business might choose
to have a generic program with a bunch of prompts/menus the user has
to navigate through. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The precursor to a system like this might be
to have receptionists &lt;em&gt;follow some script&lt;/em&gt; obeying rules rather than
using their brains to help customers solve actual problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search engines are similar. You can think of them as a "librarian
program". You can ask this AI thing for some information (using a
&lt;code&gt;search query&lt;/code&gt;) and it will return some result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is &lt;strong&gt;opaque&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;it is a &lt;strong&gt;black box&lt;/strong&gt; you cannot look
into and study directly. Google does what Google will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Exmaple Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's try to dress things up to look fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;special_topics&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;federal reserve&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;tech censorship&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;9-11 conspiracy&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;special_topics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;special_topics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Use default procedure&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;normalSearchRoutine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;strong&gt;code&lt;/strong&gt; (another word people will use to cloak their
activities in mysticism), we return &lt;em&gt;one type of result&lt;/em&gt; for certain
topics and other types of results for other topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user will approach the search engine and not know how this
works&amp;mdash;they just enter a &lt;code&gt;query&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking your Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what many of the "algorithms" of big tech are doing. The game
plan is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take some human job, and make it mechanical/codified (like how a
   call center worker may be made to read a script)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly reduce human agency, involvement in these processes. You
   might have a system that only has a human to sign off something at
   the last step, but the rest of the process proceeds without any
   human needing to know/trust another human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entirely eliminate humans, reducing the complexity of jobs that
   need to be done if necessary&amp;mdash;rather than offering custom
   jobs, offer a configuration of a handful of options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect data, tweak the algorithms, and try to &lt;em&gt;optimize&lt;/em&gt; human
   interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a bunch of anti-social nerds.o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many areas of work still must be done with human hands. But we can
expect with more IoT (Internet of Things) technology, robots, drones,
and more that more and more sectors will be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital music playback (with holograms?!??) over live performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-checkout at stores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;streaming services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mass-produced goods (often &lt;em&gt;not user servicable&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public education&amp;mdash;textbooks and standardized materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple devices (vs building and configuring your own PC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tract homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fast food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every case above, you can observe the same general pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise your &lt;strong&gt;agency&lt;/strong&gt; and take control of what you can. Understand
&lt;em&gt;your role&lt;/em&gt; in turning over stuff to "algorithms" and consider
carefully if adapting some new technology actually makes things any
better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an anti-technology post&amp;mdash;indeed I'm writing this from
a computer and publishing it to the Internet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, this is a reminder that tools should remain tools. And we
should make tools useful to us (humans) rather than shaping our habits
to fit them. You are more than a "cog in the system". You are an
individual and you do not have to &lt;em&gt;try to be unique&lt;/em&gt; by flipping the
switches to configure a "profile" for some algorithm to process and
nerds to data perv at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often these systems are very annoying. It is easier to talk with
people.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Build a library&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having your own curated collection of useful resources is a fast and
easy way to bypass search engines. For a given topic (e.g. gardening),
you can find out what the most useful resources are and build a
comprehensive knowledge store whether in PDFs, physical books, or some
other medium (even &lt;em&gt;website bookmarks&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make a kind of annotated index reminding you of what all the
resources are, who recommended them to you, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use tools like &lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt; to archive useful videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Search through someone else&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't ask Siri or "Ok Google" it, instead ask a person you are in
contact with to &lt;em&gt;help you look into a topic&lt;/em&gt;. Not only can this help
you strengthen your relationship with others (and show an eagerness to
learn and listen), you can enjoy &lt;em&gt;human comprehension&lt;/em&gt; of what you're
asking instead of screaming at a voice-activated "Artificial
Intelligence".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consider &lt;em&gt;not searching at all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for a new restaurant to try? Maybe just walk down the street
and try somewhere out. Got a question to look up? Maybe your library
(see section one) has an answer. If you never flip through your
reference materials, how can you gain familiarity with them and use
them effectively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that for anything you're trying to "learn off the Internet",
there have been people who have learned that thing &lt;em&gt;without the
Internet&lt;/em&gt; (for tech stuff like &lt;em&gt;programing&lt;/em&gt;, people have learned
similar arts, such as operating machines from manuals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a &lt;em&gt;reflex&lt;/em&gt; to turn to search engines when faced with unknowns.
Do the search engines themselves sometimes &lt;em&gt;create these problems?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approach tools with purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have met someone who spends hours upon hours reading Wikipedia
or going down some other rabbit hole. Is this a good use of time? This
is for each individual to evaluate&amp;mdash;there are times where it is
important to do deep research dives into various topics. There are
also times to recognize when "enough is enough".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being pro-active about using tools rather "reactive" or "reflex
driven" is one way to use them more effectively. For instance, you
might tell yourself,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Today, I'm only allowed 5 Google queries".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imposing a restriction like the one above forces you to carefully
search and use your computer with more intention. You can even record
what you did and write a blog post on it... lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another heuristic you can ask yourself is, "would it be more useful
for me to do jumping jacks/push-ups/etc than what I am doing now?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not ending many days of the week &lt;em&gt;physically exhausted&lt;/em&gt; but
your sucking at Google's artificial teets for much of the week,
perhaps it is time to leave infantile ways behind and cultivate a
strength you can show. You'll probably sleep better too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry><entry><title>Search Engine Stupidity, Part 1</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/search-engine-stupidity-part-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-20T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-11-20T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-11-20:/pelican-test/search-engine-stupidity-part-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Search engines use &lt;strong&gt;terms&lt;/strong&gt; ("search terms") to give you relevant

for the place you searched in all major search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Search Engines to find this sort of straightforward, homogenous
data is fast and easy. Likewise, you can search things like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measurement conversions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices of stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geographic information, e.g. locations of cities in places&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Codified knowledge, like the scientific names of plants and animals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules and regulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, you don't need a search engine to do most of these things. But
services like Google make doing these things easier than having
tables/charts for how to make conversions, reading over print
publications, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What search engines &lt;em&gt;dont&lt;/em&gt; tell you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search engines can spit you back a bunch of symbols in response to a
search query, but it is up to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; as an individual to interpret that
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, I gave some pretty dry, uninteresting search query examples.
Let's look at some other things people might search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Spanish language learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, there is a pretty standardized thing we call
&lt;em&gt;Spanish&lt;/em&gt;. There are correct and incorrect ways to conjugate verbs,
use articles with nouns, and so on and so forth. This sort of
information, you can look up. It will likely involve learning some of
the conventions of a popular dictionary (e.g. how do they indicate
what sorts of conjugations a verb uses), but once you learn how to do
this, you can quickly use searching technques to boost your language
learning speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may find that doing a Google search for something like "Spansih
language learning", rather than getting the information like I
described above, you are given links to many &lt;em&gt;products and services&lt;/em&gt;.
Now, I am not saying that there is anything &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with these
products, services, but what I am saying is that what Google is giving
to you is not just "raw information" like in the first set of cases I
introduced in this article (weather etc), but rather you are being
given suggestions on a particular sort of behavior you can follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning Spanish involves learning some grammatical rules, a bunch of
vocabulary, and getting practice applying this knowledge listening,
speaking, reading, and writing. Search engines may sort many doors to
places where you can do these things, but the search Engine doesn't
necessarily &lt;em&gt;teach you how to learn a foreign language&lt;/em&gt; or give you
the means by which to sort through these options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google can probably do a very good job giving you dates of birth and
death of various people, when named battles/wars occured, and so and
on forth. Basically, it can be a good index for historical knowledge
that is establishment accepted and codified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google might try to tell particular stories and say who is important
and why through how it ranks its results. Should you just buy the
official narrative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard sayings like "there's two sides to every story".
Likewise, when using Google to find out about history, we should be
critical of what sort of views are favored by Google (they aren't
"neutral").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that people will often talk about "algorithms" and what they do.
You cannot seperate algorithms from the people that program them and
the data they feed it. There are some pretty funny terms in machine
learning and AI research like &lt;strong&gt;supervised&lt;/strong&gt; vs &lt;strong&gt;unsupervised&lt;/strong&gt;
learning and &lt;strong&gt;discrimination tasks&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tech Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering takes careful thought and planning. Searching Google will
give you "hot" results&amp;mdash;new things that someone is hyping up.
Whether or not these solutions will actually meet your present needs
with the least amount of trouble is a different question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, consider how nowadays, there is a big push for cloud
computing everything and the "Internet of Things". Searching for tech
solutions, I am guessing you'll get a lot of these things. You
probably don't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; these things and they will likely be very
expensive &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; compromise your privacy, security, etc. That's just
the nature of letting somebody else manage your data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the most racist, micromanaged elementary school you
can&amp;mdash;that's what they do with these search algorithms.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;anti-SEO&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;that is, very &lt;em&gt;unoptimized&lt;/em&gt; for search engines.
Indeed, this is true. Search engines more easily index and point
people towards certain sorts of content. Many popular websites, which
may not be of particularly high quality, try to "game" (or &lt;em&gt;optimize&lt;/em&gt;)
on these metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you make a website that has&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many pages on many topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather short articles that load quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key words provided in &lt;strong&gt;meta data&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a website may consistently hit top search results. (If you do any
sort of tech, web programing work, you are probably aware of some
sites that do this). But these sites might SUCK. They may seem hastily
written (or even machine &lt;em&gt;generated&lt;/em&gt;), just redisplaying information
found and presented better elsewhere,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe to look up one thing really quickly, these sites might be OK,
but overally they are unpleasant to use and ugly. Searching the
official manual/documentation for whatever tech you're using would be
better in most usecases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet sites like the one above often appear at the top of search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Google favored sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies design products to please Google. Much of &lt;strong&gt;Content
Creation&lt;/strong&gt; is aimed at producing lots of thing in some form search
engines like (whether Google's, YouTubes, etc) for the purposes of
monetizing some niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the world of technology, many people choose to use
&lt;strong&gt;Medium&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, I haven't written for Medium myself, but I've read
articles on Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of things are annoying about Medium to the "end-user".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popups/invitations to join&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intrusive links and other frills to other content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not owning/exercising full control over your content and how it is
  presented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited features (not specifically sure of Medium's limitations, but
  if you're hard-coding HTML or something you're going to have &lt;em&gt;full
  control&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium makes money from their site and have much more scale than me,
so I'm not being a "hater" here. I'm just pointing out that Google
will favor a "social" type content-generation model like that used by
Medium over a rather than a go-as-I-feel-like-it blog like my own,
which is primarily shared through word of mouth or private
communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you can find many "old-style" websites that are
very pleasant to use and have a strong "personal touch". In terms of
just... providing useful or interesting information, these sites are
&lt;em&gt;just as good, if not better than a big site like Medium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet they often lack SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and so they are
far less known. They additionally lack many of the "social"
features&amp;mdash;integrations into big sites like Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leveraging Social Media and Bypassing Medium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own strategy is to make use of social media how I see
fit&amp;mdash;e.g. sharing links to friends and colleagues&amp;mdash;social
media platforms are increasingly the "marketplace" or common space in
which we are made to meet one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I try to keep my writings and other files in a less
centralized place; that's why I use &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt;, and other tools
to make my sites easy to download, redistribute, and so on if needed.
Facebook may very well be around for a while, but if I lose access to
my account, would I also want to lose access to lots of work/effort I
have put into that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralizing information, making copies, and other techniques
provide a more robust approach to controlling not just how our words
may be shared, but also as a guard against libel, censorship, and
other actions we are vulnerable towards when using social media
platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data that is &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the main data; e.g. a digital camera might
store the date/time of a photo and the name of the model of the
camera used.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The things these web frameworks â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, there are a handful of popular &lt;strong&gt;Web Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; including
React, Angular, and Vue. What these things do is allow you to use more
&lt;em&gt;programatic&lt;/em&gt; ways to spit out websites made of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript rather than writing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly.
The things these web frameworks make are often called &lt;strong&gt;single page
applications&lt;/strong&gt; (SPA) because they involve going to one URL with
&lt;strong&gt;dynamic data&lt;/strong&gt; as opposed to having you click links to navigate
through &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; pages. A popular example of a very complex SPA is
Facebook (also the company that creates the React library mentioned
above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Dynamic Web App&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Frameworks offer ways to automate tasks such as, repeating
elements. These are the bread and butter of SPAs&amp;mdash;relatively
homogenous data presented in pretty UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, on a "newsfeed", you may have a bunch of posts
structured like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Alan&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Don&amp;#39;t believe everything you see and hear on TV!
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Joe&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Do I hear MALARKEY rising?
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Donald&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        Coofefe through a mask. what a day.
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;user-post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A user that visits your dynamic web app sees this data rendered to
their web browser, whether on a laptop, phone, or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data like that above will typically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be "hardcoded" as it is in
the example above. Instead, you will likely have some external site (API)
that gives some data like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;author&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Alan&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t believe everything you see and hear on TV!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;author&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Joe&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Do I hear MALARKEY rising?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;author&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Donald&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Coofefe through a mask. what a day.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and then that data will be "digested" by a web app "frontend".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;posts.map(post =&amp;gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;user-post&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;author&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{post.author}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/author&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;message&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{post.message}&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/message&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/user-post&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analogy I often give for this is that... the "web framework" makes
a nice looking bathroom: sink, shower, etc. The backend is the
delivery of the water to the proper places. Web developers are
"Internet Plumbers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Web "App" versus the Web Site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for a job in "coding", you'll probably get most people telling
you to go and learn one of the web frameworks mentioned here because
they are a popular way for large companies to make websites. Social
media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and the like make use of these
sorts of things. For these sites, it makes sense to have fancy ways
for generating &lt;em&gt;dynamic content&lt;/em&gt; because they are constantly updating
their databases with things people (and robots) produce and displaying
these things to users as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense why companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter have
been at the forefront of making many of the modern technologies we use
today when you think about the sort of content they deal with and at
the massive sacale they strive for. These sites value things like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactivity (users clicking buttons, typing stuff)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huge quantities of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of integrating advertisements, third party components, and
  other avenues of monetization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, on a "traditional" website, you cannot get data in "real
time". It is necessary to refresh webpages to &lt;em&gt;ask the server&lt;/em&gt; for new
information. "Traditional" webpages are more like books, pamphlets, or
brochures that don't frequently update but nonetheless may contain
lots of valuable information presented (hopefully) in an accessible
way. It is more common for "traditional" websites to have many
custom-made, unique pages as opposed to homogenous "posts" or "tweets"
which restrict what kind of content users can post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choose the tools for the job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern web framework is built for making &lt;strong&gt;web applications&lt;/strong&gt;
(apps) that deal with dynamic data. Implied with &lt;em&gt;dynamic data&lt;/em&gt; is
interfacing with some kind of database, which often means using a
cloud provider like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure. Creating a web
app often means committing to working with certain big companies,
using technology you may need to update, and learning more complex
tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the attractive high paying sort of web jobs will often mean working
with big clients in government, NGOs, and big corporations who collect
lots and lots of data, specializing in making dynamic web apps is a
popular career path for technophilic individuals who want nice things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, making a traditional website can be relatively
straight forward. There are many very smart people who have their own
websites, but but care less about fancy styling. For example, a
college professor may just want to link some publications, give a
contact address, and post one photo. This is not hard to do and
doesn't require hiring a full-time developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't really fair to compare an individual's homepage with
Facebook&amp;mdash;asking which is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; is kind of non-sensical
because they are really two different things. One is a fancy kitchen
sink hooked up to straight to the US government and another may just
be a weekend project for sharing family recipes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry><entry><title>Create React App: An Entry Point into "Modern" Web Development</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/create-react-app-an-entry-point-into-modern-web-development.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-18T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-05-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-05-18:/pelican-test/create-react-app-an-entry-point-into-modern-web-development.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Introducing React&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular way to build websites these days is to use
&lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, which is officially described as "A

&lt;p&gt;A popular way to build websites these days is to use
&lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, which is officially described as "A
JavaScript library for building user interfaces".  With React, you
write JavaScript which does stuff in a "virtual DOM" rather than the
(browser's) DOM directly. In this way, you can work with some nice
abstractions that get "compiled" down to stuff a browser understands
natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use React, you only need one web page&amp;mdash;we'll call this
&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;. You use JavaScript to "inject" everything into some
root. Using React, you will assume your users have JavaScript enabled
in their browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;noscript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;u need javascript&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;noscript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using JavaScript to simulate different pages (by rendering different
"components"), you can provide users with a very fast-feeling
experience. This is because instead of requesting new pages from a
server when you click around your web app, you are just shuffling
around stuff in the aforementioned "Virtual DOM" using React's
(JavaScript) library. The result is near-zero "loading time" switching
between complex views which need not be organized in static "pages".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Create React App to skip the setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginners with React typically start building apps using a tool called
&lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app"&gt;&lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This tool gives a basic working app ("website") with a bunch of fancy
features ready to be used. For example,
&lt;a href="https://webpack.js.org/"&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;a "modular
bundler"&amp;mdash;already comes set up and ready to use. You can write
your JavaScript app in a bunch of files, use &lt;code&gt;imports&lt;/code&gt; and stuff and
rely on the default setup to package up everything together to be
deployed to the web. You can get a flying start trying out things like
JSX (HTML-looking JavaScript syntax used with React). Since
&lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; is a pretty popular tool, it is convenient to
search stuff like how to deploy an app created with this tool to
places like &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; is how I personally got started with my
programing career &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I heard React was the hottest, latest and
greatest technology so I went and learned the basics using
&lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; so I could go find work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; installed, you can start using
&lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; by calling &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app name-of-my-new-app
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; name-of-my-new-app &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Navigate into the directory of your new app&lt;/span&gt;
npm start &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Start the development server&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly created app will contain a &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file that includes
instructions on how to do some basic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically where people go from here is to open up their new app
directory in VS Code, which has big bucks (Microsoft) behind it as
well as armies of people making extensions and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is nice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set-up described above is not so difficult to do. You can start
using fancy features like cutting-edge new JavaScript syntax right
away.  You can create a production build with &lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt;. You can
expand what &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; gives you by installing new packages.
The already-bundled script allow you to think less about setup and
config and focus your energies on doing things like making stuff
pretty with CSS and following the official docs on &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html"&gt;"Thinking in
React"&lt;/a&gt;.
You are well-equipped to enter the "React cult".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where trouble begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overally, as a tool for getting started and trying out some new
technology, &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; is very nice. It can be dangerous to
use, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more complex of a job you are trying to do, you will find that you
will butt heads with &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;. You are given many
pre-configured &lt;em&gt;layers of abstraction&lt;/em&gt;, set up for getting to work
quickly. When something goes wrong or when you need a new specific
functionality, it may be necessary to "look under the hood" and find
out "how the sausage is made".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the "flying start" granted by &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; may
cause more trouble for you than it helps because it encourages you to
use all sorts of things you are not familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More experienced developers than me tell me that they more often than
not &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; use &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; because if they are trying to do
something specific, it is easier to start from smaller building blocks
and build up a nice configuration. This is not too unlike the attitude
of many Linux "power users" that that prefer to start with something
like Debian or Arch Linux (relatively few default packages to start
with) rather than installing a more "user-friendly" distribution like
Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For smaller, more isolated problems or reproducing examples of
specific issues, there are tools like
&lt;a href="https://codepen.io/"&gt;codepen.io&lt;/a&gt; which require no installation on
your part. Other setups, such as
&lt;a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/"&gt;GatsbyJS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;a static site
generator&amp;mdash;will use React with a different configuration than
&lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More general issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, reaching for a popular "modern" solution like React is the
gut reaction for developers. Personally, I began learning React
because there were lots of job listings that mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conveniences given by tools like &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; encourage
(new) developers to jump into complicated technology "stacks" because
it is easy to introduce a huge lump of technology with minimal effort
at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many costs, however, to pay after enjoying this initial
convenience. A big one for beginning developers is having a big pile
of technology of which you understand little to nothing of many of its
parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pain of working through setting up a new project with a complex
tech stack is instructive in that it encourages you to think about why
it is(n't) worth it to introduce XYZ new and fancy
feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for this reason that many more experienced developers than me
recommend focusing on fundamentals such as (vanilla) JavaScript, HTML,
and CSS on the front end plus some knowledge of how HTTP works, what
good structures in databases look like, and common practices for doing
things like authentication and handling file uploads in backend code.&lt;/p&gt;

components into their sites which ignore this built in functionality.
The result is UI &lt;strong&gt;bloat&lt;/strong&gt;. There are multiple back buttons displayed
for most users, both those on screen and those on the browser
itself. Rather than having content quickly and cleanly delivered, we
are faced with all-looking-the-same websites, which are supposedly
user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual users can do things to get rid of browser clutter. However,
most people aren't nerds who tweak their browser settings to hide
things they don't want (or who set up stuff like &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; keybindings for
their browser).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content First&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making use of browser buttons instead of cluttering a UI with your own
buttons puts your &lt;em&gt;content first&lt;/em&gt;. Navigating your web pages should be
non-annoying, but is not the main reason people (should) visit your
website. Hopefully you have something useful to offer that pretty
menus and spinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Peripheral friendliness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other advantage of making use of normal BACK/FORWARD functionality
is that many keyboards and mice (as well as other things, like game
controllers) can be set up to access these functions on convenient
thumb-buttons and other more ergonomic fixtures. Save your ass
expensive medical bills from &lt;b&gt;RSI&lt;/b&gt; and stuff and build for the
future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Action plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to write many web pages that you have to use your browser
navigation to get away from. No need to write another "back" button if
you can just press back. No layers of abstraction above normal browser
navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other technical notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern web tech like &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; piles on some layers of abstraction
through things like &lt;strong&gt;dynamic routing&lt;/strong&gt; with tools like &lt;strong&gt;React
router&lt;/strong&gt; to implement forward-back functionality in &lt;strong&gt;Single Page
Applications&lt;/strong&gt; (SPA). This is understandable for making snappy web
pages that feel "modern".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you don't load too many images and other media, keep
things clean and simple, etc., web pages don't even take that long to
load.

anti-Facebook articles. Should you get off Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not quit Facebook. Here's some reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using an online platform transparently linked to your real-world
   offers many advantages over anonymous platforms for &lt;strong&gt;connecting
   with real-life friends and family â€¦&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick Internet search (c.f. &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; search) will reveal troves of

&lt;p&gt;I have not quit Facebook. Here's some reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using an online platform transparently linked to your real-world
   offers many advantages over anonymous platforms for &lt;strong&gt;connecting
   with real-life friends and family, commerce, and finding new
   communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook will harvest data on you (you "node" in its graph) whether
   you like it or not; might as well &lt;strong&gt;take as much control&lt;/strong&gt; of your
   user profile as you can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;train Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; to be more useful to you: e.g. use
   Facebook to study a foreign language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding Facebook is a &lt;strong&gt;marketable skill&lt;/strong&gt;: particularly,
   managing ad campaigns, administering pages, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that can manage not being totally addicted to Facebook, I
think it is a decently good idea to reclaim Facebook as &lt;em&gt;your public
facing platform&lt;/em&gt;. Facebook is now a rather established platform that
offers many useful services. Approaching Facebook purposefully, you
can leverage it to be an overall good thing in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't be a coward, show your face!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many places on the Internet where users communicate with
(relative) anonymity, hiding behind an anime profile picture, an image
of a cute dog/cat, some meme character, etc.  Certainly, there are
cases where anonymity is useful, notably for &lt;strong&gt;whistleblowers&lt;/strong&gt; or
other individuals who &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be anonymous for their own safety.  I
support the creation and maintenance of places for people to
communicate anonymously (and oppose "deplatforming" in the USA where I
live, generally), but I don't think they are good for most people most
of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some general points about how anonymity can lead to bad
behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little to no "&lt;strong&gt;skin in the game&lt;/strong&gt;" causes people to speak
  recklessly or to take actions that can hurt others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escapism&lt;/strong&gt; is encouraged; &lt;strong&gt;accountability&lt;/strong&gt; is avoided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trends&lt;/strong&gt; are more difficult to assess; prolific shit-posters may
  inflate the relevance of certain themes, bringing the fringe to the
  mainstream; different information ecosystems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, having a real-world identity linked up with online
interactions encourages people to treat each other more politely and
avoid being overtly nasty as the Internet functions as something of a
public record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a real-world identity online encoruages people to use online
platforms as &lt;em&gt;a gateway to offline interactions&lt;/em&gt;. Logistics can be
handled much more easily if everyone involved is familiar with social
media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of ads and influence (what I like to call "the dark
arts") is a big topic, especially following all the 2016 presidential
election stuff. That being said, a platform like Facebook allows
astute users to observe who is pushing what agenda more
transparently. Ads have to be pushed by someone for something, after
all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control your node&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spoken to friends who at some point or another decided to
"close" their Facebook accounts. To the best of my knowledge, Facebook
makes no promises at ever completely deleting your stuff, so closing
your account is essentially forfeiting control of your node (data representing you on Facebook's &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview"&gt;Graph API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing to keep a Facebook account (even if you don't use it much) is
akin to holding onto property you'd rather have &lt;em&gt;not abused&lt;/em&gt; event if
you aren't actively using it. Particularly for public-facing
individuals, keeping control of Facebook content about you might be a
good idea,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Train Facebook to do what you want&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook's &lt;strong&gt;Feed&lt;/strong&gt; has been the subject of lots of controversy.  Many
things about it are opaque to end users. However, in general, a "what
you put into the surveillance state browser is what you get out of it"
principle seems to hold true for most people I have discussed these
issues with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you log into Google chrome and search for digital camera things on
Amazon, what sort of ads do you expect to see in Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can train Facebook to give you more of what you think you &lt;em&gt;should
be seeing&lt;/em&gt;. For example, if you are trying to do more home cooking,
just go search some cooking stuff. Facebook will probably feed you
lots of interesting inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purposefully use Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I only pick up phone calls if I am expecting a call or if
the number calling is one I recognize. This has saved lots of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching Facebook with a &lt;strong&gt;policy&lt;/strong&gt; like how many people approach
phone calls can allow you to leverage this powerful platform to
enhance your life. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry><entry><title>I choose HTML</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/i-choose-html.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-07-20:/pelican-test/i-choose-html.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before, I built &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/me"&gt;my website in

&lt;p&gt;I was trying out some different Linux distributions, and decided to
give the fully-free distro &lt;a href="https://trisquel.info"&gt;Trisquel&lt;/a&gt; a spin.
To my dismay, I found that &lt;a href="http://captainalan.github.io/me"&gt;&lt;em&gt;my own
site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was blocked blocked for some
JavaScript-y reasons. It turns out that all sites that make use of
React (or at least &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;, the tool I used to bootstrap my
site) are &lt;em&gt;blocked&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/"&gt;certain sorts of
JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; are blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my goal to produce informative, unobtrusive websites that are
easily indexed, linked, downloaded, etc. If I can accomplish this goal
without freedom/privacy threatening software, why not choose simpler
tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am becoming more interested in &lt;strong&gt;static site generators&lt;/strong&gt; (such as
&lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, which was used to make this
site) because the HTML/CSS they spit out is compatible in most places
and they also make things like RSS feeds easy to do. I'll be trying
out various static generators in addition to writing plain HTML/CSS
and maybe some JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Static Sites?</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/why-static-sites.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-15T10:13:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-15T10:13:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-05-15:/pelican-test/why-static-sites.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Updated 8/12/2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After half a year or so of learning all about dynamic websites (using
fancy new technology like Node.js), I've found myself returning to
good old-fashioned static sites for my personal projects. Here I'll go
through some reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write â€¦&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Updated 8/12/2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After half a year or so of learning all about dynamic websites (using
fancy new technology like Node.js), I've found myself returning to
good old-fashioned static sites for my personal projects. Here I'll go
through some reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write a program that produces content for that user when a
   user runs it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write a program that produces content; you then distribute that
   content to people that want it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first approach here is how a lot of &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; websites work. You
write &lt;strong&gt;server side code&lt;/strong&gt; in something like JavaScript (Node), PHP,
Python, etc. to produce webpages on the fly for users. To do this,
you may have to go through lots of trials and tribulations to get your
program ('website') up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second approach is how &lt;em&gt;static sites&lt;/em&gt; work. The "programming"
involved (if any) is to generate content once. Compare this to
&lt;em&gt;compiling&lt;/em&gt; a high(er) level programming language into machine
code. Once you produce useful output, it is easy to distribute it
(there are many places, including GitHub pages, that can serve
&lt;strong&gt;static assets&lt;/strong&gt; for free).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dynamic websites, you might worry about hackers sending malicious
inputs into your website and blowing stuff up. With static websites,
this is not an issue. If you were really worried about one server
where your content is hosted, you could easily create &lt;strong&gt;mirror(s)&lt;/strong&gt; of
your content. Static sites deploy easily, without special
considerations about what will compile, what will be allowed,
etc. Everything is packaged up nicely and good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know your needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, static sites will do. Don't be pulled in by the buzz
words and hype of fancy platforms if all you need is some hosting for
HTML/CSS files and some images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplifying web development means having more time available to focus
on producing quality content, rather than wrestling with abstractions
and engineering-ish problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you should write a math or engineering blog if you wanna do
either of those activities, respectively ðŸ˜¡&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry></feed>
