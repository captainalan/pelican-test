anti-Facebook articles. Should you get off Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not quit Facebook. Here's some reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using an online platform transparently linked to your real-world
   offers many advantages over anonymous platforms for &lt;strong&gt;connecting
   with real-life friends and family …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick Internet search (c.f. &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; search) will reveal troves of
anti-Facebook articles. Should you get off Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not quit Facebook. Here's some reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using an online platform transparently linked to your real-world
   offers many advantages over anonymous platforms for &lt;strong&gt;connecting
   with real-life friends and family, commerce, and finding new
   communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook will harvest data on you (you "node" in its graph) whether
   you like it or not; might as well &lt;strong&gt;take as much control&lt;/strong&gt; of your
   user profile as you can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;train Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; to be more useful to you: e.g. use
   Facebook to study a foreign language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding Facebook is a &lt;strong&gt;marketable skill&lt;/strong&gt;: particularly,
   managing ad campaigns, administering pages, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that can manage not being totally addicted to Facebook, I
think it is a decently good idea to reclaim Facebook as &lt;em&gt;your public
facing platform&lt;/em&gt;. Facebook is now a rather established platform that
offers many useful services. Approaching Facebook purposefully, you
can leverage it to be an overall good thing in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't be a coward, show your face!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many places on the Internet where users communicate with
(relative) anonymity, hiding behind an anime profile picture, an image
of a cute dog/cat, some meme character, etc.  Certainly, there are
cases where anonymity is useful, notably for &lt;strong&gt;whistleblowers&lt;/strong&gt; or
other individuals who &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be anonymous for their own safety.  I
support the creation and maintenance of places for people to
communicate anonymously (and oppose "deplatforming" in the USA where I
live, generally), but I don't think they are good for most people most
of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some general points about how anonymity can lead to bad
behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little to no "&lt;strong&gt;skin in the game&lt;/strong&gt;" causes people to speak
  recklessly or to take actions that can hurt others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escapism&lt;/strong&gt; is encouraged; &lt;strong&gt;accountability&lt;/strong&gt; is avoided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trends&lt;/strong&gt; are more difficult to assess; prolific shit-posters may
  inflate the relevance of certain themes, bringing the fringe to the
  mainstream; different information ecosystems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, having a real-world identity linked up with online
interactions encourages people to treat each other more politely and
avoid being overtly nasty as the Internet functions as something of a
public record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a real-world identity online encoruages people to use online
platforms as &lt;em&gt;a gateway to offline interactions&lt;/em&gt;. Logistics can be
handled much more easily if everyone involved is familiar with social
media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of ads and influence (what I like to call "the dark
arts") is a big topic, especially following all the 2016 presidential
election stuff. That being said, a platform like Facebook allows
astute users to observe who is pushing what agenda more
transparently. Ads have to be pushed by someone for something, after
all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control your node&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spoken to friends who at some point or another decided to
"close" their Facebook accounts. To the best of my knowledge, Facebook
makes no promises at ever completely deleting your stuff, so closing
your account is essentially forfeiting control of your node (data representing you on Facebook's &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview"&gt;Graph API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing to keep a Facebook account (even if you don't use it much) is
akin to holding onto property you'd rather have &lt;em&gt;not abused&lt;/em&gt; event if
you aren't actively using it. Particularly for public-facing
individuals, keeping control of Facebook content about you might be a
good idea,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Train Facebook to do what you want&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook's &lt;strong&gt;Feed&lt;/strong&gt; has been the subject of lots of controversy.  Many
things about it are opaque to end users. However, in general, a "what
you put into the surveillance state browser is what you get out of it"
principle seems to hold true for most people I have discussed these
issues with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you log into Google chrome and search for digital camera things on
Amazon, what sort of ads do you expect to see in Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can train Facebook to give you more of what you think you &lt;em&gt;should
be seeing&lt;/em&gt;. For example, if you are trying to do more home cooking,
just go search some cooking stuff. Facebook will probably feed you
lots of interesting inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purposefully use Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I only pick up phone calls if I am expecting a call or if
the number calling is one I recognize. This has saved lots of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching Facebook with a &lt;strong&gt;policy&lt;/strong&gt; like how many people approach
phone calls can allow you to leverage this powerful platform to
enhance your life. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry><entry><title>I choose HTML</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/i-choose-html.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-07-20:/pelican-test/i-choose-html.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before, I built &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/me"&gt;my website in

&lt;p&gt;I was trying out some different Linux distributions, and decided to
give the fully-free distro &lt;a href="https://trisquel.info"&gt;Trisquel&lt;/a&gt; a spin.
To my dismay, I found that &lt;a href="http://captainalan.github.io/me"&gt;&lt;em&gt;my own
site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was blocked blocked for some
JavaScript-y reasons. It turns out that all sites that make use of
React (or at least &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;, the tool I used to bootstrap my
site) are &lt;em&gt;blocked&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/"&gt;certain sorts of
JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; are blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my goal to produce informative, unobtrusive websites that are
easily indexed, linked, downloaded, etc. If I can accomplish this goal
without freedom/privacy threatening software, why not choose simpler
tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am becoming more interested in &lt;strong&gt;static site generators&lt;/strong&gt; (such as
&lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, which was used to make this
site) because the HTML/CSS they spit out is compatible in most places
and they also make things like RSS feeds easy to do. I'll be trying
out various static generators in addition to writing plain HTML/CSS
and maybe some JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Static Sites?</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/why-static-sites.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-15T10:13:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-15T10:13:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-05-15:/pelican-test/why-static-sites.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Updated 8/12/2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After half a year or so of learning all about dynamic websites (using
fancy new technology like Node.js), I've found myself returning to
good old-fashioned static sites for my personal projects. Here I'll go
through some reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Updated 8/12/2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After half a year or so of learning all about dynamic websites (using
fancy new technology like Node.js), I've found myself returning to
good old-fashioned static sites for my personal projects. Here I'll go
through some reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write a program that produces content for that user when a
   user runs it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write a program that produces content; you then distribute that
   content to people that want it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first approach here is how a lot of &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; websites work. You
write &lt;strong&gt;server side code&lt;/strong&gt; in something like JavaScript (Node), PHP,
Python, etc. to produce webpages on the fly for users. To do this,
you may have to go through lots of trials and tribulations to get your
program ('website') up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second approach is how &lt;em&gt;static sites&lt;/em&gt; work. The "programming"
involved (if any) is to generate content once. Compare this to
&lt;em&gt;compiling&lt;/em&gt; a high(er) level programming language into machine
code. Once you produce useful output, it is easy to distribute it
(there are many places, including GitHub pages, that can serve
&lt;strong&gt;static assets&lt;/strong&gt; for free).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dynamic websites, you might worry about hackers sending malicious
inputs into your website and blowing stuff up. With static websites,
this is not an issue. If you were really worried about one server
where your content is hosted, you could easily create &lt;strong&gt;mirror(s)&lt;/strong&gt; of
your content. Static sites deploy easily, without special
considerations about what will compile, what will be allowed,
etc. Everything is packaged up nicely and good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know your needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, static sites will do. Don't be pulled in by the buzz
words and hype of fancy platforms if all you need is some hosting for
HTML/CSS files and some images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplifying web development means having more time available to focus
on producing quality content, rather than wrestling with abstractions
and engineering-ish problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you should write a math or engineering blog if you wanna do
either of those activities, respectively 😡&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry></feed>
