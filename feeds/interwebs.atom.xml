&lt;p&gt;I was trying out some different Linux distributions, and decided to
give the fully-free distro &lt;a href="https://trisquel.info"&gt;Trisquel&lt;/a&gt; a spin.
To my dismay, I found that &lt;a href="http://captainalan.github.io/me"&gt;&lt;em&gt;my own
site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was blocked blocked for some
JavaScript-y reasons. It turns out that all sites that make use of
React (or at least &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;, the tool I used to bootstrap my
site) are &lt;em&gt;blocked&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/"&gt;certain sorts of
JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; are blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my goal to produce informative, unobtrusive websites
that are easily indexed, linked, downloaded, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am becoming more interested in &lt;strong&gt;static site generators&lt;/strong&gt; (such as
&lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, which was used to make this
site) because the HTML/CSS they spit out is compatible in most places
and they also make things like RSS feeds easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Why Static Sites?</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/why-static-sites.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-15T10:13:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-15T10:13:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-05-15:/pelican-test/why-static-sites.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Static sites deploy easily, without special considerations about what

will compile, what will be allowed, etc. Everything is packaged up
nicely and good to go. Its like grabbing an an acoustic guitar and
just beginning to play versus doing a complex setup with an electric
guitar. Sure, you can make more different sounds in the latter setup,
but there are also bigger hurdles to overcome if you just want to get
started practicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplifying web development means having more time available to focus
on producing quality content, rather than wrestling with abstractions
and engineering-ish problems. You should write a math blog or a maker
blog if you wanna do either of those activities, respectively ðŸ˜¡&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
