switched from typing using the standard QWERTY layout to using the
alternative, more efficient Dvorak layout. However, after using Dvorak
for some time, working my typing speed to over 100 WPM, I ultimately
chose to &lt;em&gt;switch back to QWERTY&lt;/em&gt; (more on my experience
&lt;a href="https://haksayng.com/blog/2017/08/14/relearning-totype/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
Why would anyone re-learn how to type twice&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reasons I had for doing this were,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compatibility with the world at large (I had to help other people
   use their computers), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the gains/advantages I got from switching to an alternative
   keyboard layout came mainly from improved typing technique rather
   than a "better layout".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issues interfacing with software designed for a QWERTY-based
   windows, such as shortcuts keys in games/graphics applications/etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great Internet Historian &lt;a href="http://xahlee.info/"&gt;Xah Lee&lt;/a&gt; has called my
default-embracing ways &lt;strong&gt;QWERTY Theory&lt;/strong&gt;. I like this label because
"theory" implies it is &lt;em&gt;not just about keyboards&lt;/em&gt;. It is an approach
to technology generally which advocates &lt;em&gt;making the best use of
commonly available default options, focusing on improving technique
rather than exploiting customization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will detail what QWERTY Theory is and isn't and how it
can help you make a million bucks. Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thou Shalt Not Covet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory inherits from a Judeo-Christian moral framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your
neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or
anything that belongs to your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Exodus 20:17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with the axiom: the basic tools you have in front of you are
good enough. Avert your eyes from the fancy-things others possess and
meditate upon how you can do better with what you already have to face
whatever issues are in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some applications,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing more sustainable typing habits by training new muscle
  memory to hit default key bindings (e.g. pressing the CTRL key with
  your &lt;em&gt;thumbs&lt;/em&gt; rather than pinkies&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing physical training using simple or no equipment (e.g. dumbells
  you already have) rather than signing up for a fancy gym, buying an
  expensive new machine, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practicing more on your $200 guitar instead of looking at ads for a
  $2000 guitar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time may come to upgrade your tools, but for now think about what
you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do, envisioning how you can use the tools you have better.
QWERTY Theory is about pursuing mastery of the mundane, focusing on
building upon rather than inverting tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know Thyself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes
wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Proverbs 11:2 (NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY theory is suitable for non-geniuses who want to be productive
with existing infrastructure. Chances are, you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be
&lt;em&gt;the chosen one&lt;/em&gt; who is going to revolutionize computer input devices
&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, it is important to be able to work effectively with
standard setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may at first seem "efficient" to optimize things like keyboard
entry speed, but there are many "hidden costs" that come with every
deviation from the
"&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software"&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom configurations of software often amounts to demanding special
attention that should be reserved for disabled people who have no
other choice but to use speialized setups. QWERTY theory says to not
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=LARP"&gt;LARP&lt;/a&gt; as being
an oppressed class because being a nerd is a not a disability &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case Study: Fahrenheit vs Celsius&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of alternative ways of doing things (e.g. typing in Dvorak
versus QWERTY) often claim some "scientific" basis for why their way
of doing things is superior. Oftentimes, further inspection reveals
nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, consider the claim that "using Celsius is more
&lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; than using Fahrenheit". Someone
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_(contemporary_subculture)"&gt;hipster&lt;/a&gt;
living in the United States may go around using Celsius and causing
trouble for everyone around them. Is Celsius really &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than
Fahrenheit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at &lt;em&gt;whole integer&lt;/em&gt; values (e.g. 85 degrees F), Fahrenheit
has better resolution than Celsius. This is relevant because sometimes
displays will only allow two or three digits, or only show integer
temperatures rather than crowd the UI with a decimal. If some
numb-skull tells you that Celsius is more "scientific" than
Fahrenheit, just tell them that Celsius and Fahrenheit are both linear
transformations off Kelvin and that you aren't living at sea level and
boiling water there (situation used to determine Celsius' offset from
Kelvin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better reason to use Celsius over Fahrenheit is because Celsius is a
more widely adopted int he world at large; QWERTY Theory! It is not
because Celsius "is more scientific" or some bullshit like that.
It is to fall into line with convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many nerds eventually repent and turn away from their alt-keyboard
fetishizing, returning to their QWERTYc roots. In "&lt;a href="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/porn_zen_and_vimrc/"&gt;Porn, Zen, and
.vimrc&lt;/a&gt;"
(Koncevičius ) we see a heartfelt confession of an over-config'er (in
this case, someone who dived deeply into customizing the &lt;a href="https://www.vim.org/"&gt;Vim text
editor&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...The simple truth was that, no matter how much energy I invested
in my custom configuration, the people who built and designed Vim
knew it a lot better than me. And it hit me like a cold shower:
implemented defaults and design was there for a reason. Some of my
perceived inconsistencies were products of my limited
understanding. I made assumptions about what a particular command
should do, when it should be used, and how. But those assumptions
were not always warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory is about embracing the fact that the shapes technologies
around us have taken have survived and thrived for reasons we may not
immediately understand. Properties may arise that were no individuals'
"original design" but are rather products of processes of
collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY theory protects against the "efficient inefficiency" of
assuming you are more clever than all sorts of people in the past
because you discovered some quick "hack" to optimize something in your
life &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory is seeing that the "illogical" nature of English
spelling is necessarily "stupid"; there is no need to rush to
&lt;em&gt;optimize English spelling to be more phonetic&lt;/em&gt;. Who assumed a more
phonetic writing system is &lt;em&gt;better?&lt;/em&gt; Perhaps, we should speak more
like how we write instead of writing more like we speak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory is leveraging existing systems, improving technique, and
preparing for full-scale change rather than pre-maturely optimizing
unwieldy channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;analyze stuff to see why I was wrong and hopefully learn something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, I do a write-up here because it is more interesting
than being wish-washy and saying "it's complicated" without making any
concrete predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No "Universal Vaccination"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that we'll see a widely accepted vaccine being developed
in the next month or two. By the time something is developed, I think
that the main "scare" of COVID-19 will be past.  Already, we see many
places starting to open up &lt;em&gt;despite there being no vaccine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sub-claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things will continue opening up, regardless if there is a vaccine or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a vaccine is developed, stuff will likely already be sufficiently
  opened up that people will opt out of taking it unless forced to
  (e.g. by their employer, government mandate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, I think more people will start getting flu shots and stuff
  after COVID-19, but institutional skepticism on a whole will
  likewise grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forced vaccination will be met with resistance from vocal
  minorities; in practice I think you can't force everyone to have a
  vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remote Work Will Grow, But Not Dramatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people got to "experiment" with remote work. Most people I have
talked with that have kept their jobs &lt;em&gt;don't like remote work&lt;/em&gt;. With
certain exceptions (e.g. computer programers), I think that
by-in-large, people will want to continue working in offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerds often think that other people have "rational" motivation
structures like them. They fail to see that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many (most?) people are strongly driven by external motivation,
  which can be negative (fear of punishment) or positive (praise,
  raises, etc.); traditional workplaces make it easier to deliver
  these incentives than remote work which puts a lot of
  technology-fiddling overhead on most involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people at some point declare "technological bankruptcy"; they
  simply decide they don't/can't use XYZ technology and stop learning
  more; learning new tech all the time is something nerds gravitate
  towards, but most people hate doing this and will resist change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote work &lt;em&gt;is costly&lt;/em&gt;; while paying rent for an office is
  expensive, wasting time dealing with people's failing microphones,
  noisy backgrounds, accidental screenshares, etc. wastes a lot of
  time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many jobs filled with people already well-prepared for remote work
will likely continue exploring/expanding remote operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think there will be a general trend for non-nerd work to
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; become more remote; many people have tried remote work and
decided &lt;em&gt;they don't like it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Establishment Will Survive (and Thrive)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many small businesses might get hit very hard, but the big players are
likely to sale through all of this stuff OK. Many tech stocks are
likely to do quite well, e.g. Amazon. I think that banks and oil will
also end up OK because of how tied up in government things they are;
the establishment is continuing the "too big to fail" thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that banks, companies, etc. will have rather lenient policies
for repaying loans and stuff &lt;em&gt;for the time being&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;meaning, we're not
going to see thugs from credit card companies knocking on people's
doors demanding money any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like college debt, I think that repayment stuff &lt;em&gt;will be
remembered&lt;/em&gt; by the establishment and there will be nothing like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_(biblical)"&gt;The
Jubilee&lt;/a&gt; given
to those hard hit by COVID-19, just temporary "good enough" relief to
prevent angry mobs with pitchforks and fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 stuff slowly wraps up, I think that people will emerge
with dramatically different conclusions. Many prepper/right-wing types
will emerge feeling vindicated for taking things into their own hands
and preparing supplies and stuff before all this virus business.
They&amp;mdash;along with many religious people&amp;mdash;will (correctly) see
that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Times of chaos can and will be used by governments to extend usual
  authority and implement new "temporary" policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Temporary" measures put in place during times of emergency may be
  used for all sorts of tricky stuff later (see 9-11, PATRIOT Act, and
  the expansion of the surveillance state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many on the political left would like a more "maternal" state caring
  for (and controlling) the population in various ways, e.g. pushing
  solutions for how the nation &lt;em&gt;as a whole&lt;/em&gt; should evaluate and
  respond to risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, more left-leaning types will emerge feeling
vindicated by (correctly) seeing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their nations are ununified; struggles between different groups and
  partisan media that focuses on &lt;em&gt;differences&lt;/em&gt; rather than on how
  people are similar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many rejecting mainstream science (acting like "idiots" in their
  view); we will see many examples of more right-wing type people
  dying and stuff because they didn't listen to the establishment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A more urgent demand/need for healthcare reform (or &lt;em&gt;¡revolución!&lt;/em&gt;)
  in the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How capitalism as a sole operating principle doesn't solve
  everything (think: critique of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3164890827?book_show_action=false&amp;amp;from_review_page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atlas
  Shrugged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  by Ayn Rand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't expect to see much jumping from one side or the other of the
political spectrum. Left-leaning people will dig deeper into the need
for institutional solutions while more libertarian x right-leaning
people will want the establishment to
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BTFO"&gt;BTFO&lt;/a&gt;.  Both
the left and right broadly (no, you &lt;em&gt;NUANCE BROS&lt;/em&gt;, I'm not going to
"resist the dichotomy") will be able to find validation for their
worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, all in all, I think the right-wingers will come out feeling a
lot better than the left-wingers overall. This is because the
left-wingers want institutional solutions to what they perceive as
problems, and COVID-19 (metaphorically) kicked the establishment in
the balls. The establishment is rolling around in pain a little bit
now &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Bernie Sanders is not the Dem party blessed
choice. Meanwhile, right wingers with their values in self-sufficiency
and building up families and communities (rather than exploring the
arts) instead of state power (okay, now I'm talking more about
&lt;strong&gt;libertarian&lt;/strong&gt; leaning right-wing types, not war-hawk hegemonic
theocratic types) will emerge from all of this feeling like had been
on the right track before all of this with their trucks, guns, and
gallons of water.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Smartphones suck.</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/smartphones-suck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-04T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-05-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-05-04:/pelican-test/smartphones-suck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now in the second deade of the twentieth century, rather than getting

&lt;p&gt;Smartphones suck. They suck your time and attention. They suck your
bank account(s) dry, especially if you have set up "convenient"
payment systems and find yourself near vending machines stocked with
tasty energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a society, I think it is in our best interest to talk about
smartphones like how we talk about drugs and alcohol. They can be
fun/useful for some things, but definitely not for everyone and
something to be approached with caution. Many wisely choose to abstain
completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Personal Surveillance Devices"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are personalized advertisement aggregating surveillance
devices. You pay money to get tracked. "Security" isn't about &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;,
it's about your digital persona, a marketable product that you do not
own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited privileges you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; grow a big
business, become famous, etc.; likewise, by owning a typewriter you
&lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; write a best-selling novel. Most people don't do this though;
most people lose &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bigly"&gt;bigly&lt;/a&gt; with
most minutes spent on smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use a smartphone, you are given limited access to a little
node on a big &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt;. The
companies that own these graphs are firstly Google and Apple, who
control Android and iOS an their stores, respectively &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  The
tracking doesn't stop there, however. All big "social" apps, including
multiplayer games and other "fun" diversions, have similar tracking
features. Your phone (and by extension Apple and Google) also knows
how much time you spend on each app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, this is OK because "I don't mind being tracked
because I'm not doing anything wrong". That might be a fine view to
have &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, but what will you do if the political fashionistas decide
that some view you have is a Nazi view? Do not support "the purge"
because you expect to get out okay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Physical and Social Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people use their smartphones kinda like personal trainers. Their
phones pump media into their brains while ordering them to do pushups
and stuff (see the "&lt;a href="https://7-min.com/"&gt;7 Minute Workout&lt;/a&gt;", for a
representative example) &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Most people, however, don't use their
smartphones in this way. Their smartphones, rather than functioning as
motivational coaches, work as myopia inducing, posture destroying,
distraction vectors that literally get thousands (more?) of people
killed every year. You might develop &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury"&gt;Repetitive Strain
Injury&lt;/a&gt; from
swiping your thumbs over a glass plate all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart phones force you into &lt;strong&gt;corporate mediated communication&lt;/strong&gt;
because all of the chatting and stuff you do through a smartphone
passes through the filters of &lt;em&gt;someone else's servers&lt;/em&gt;. Sneaky
advertisements influence your thoughts. You may &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you are
ignoring them, the the dark arts of advertisement penetrate deep and
&lt;em&gt;NONE ARE IMMUNE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socially, this means that people are &lt;em&gt;increasingly optimized as
particular types of consumers&lt;/em&gt;. Smartphones put you on an
advertisement to purchase pipeline. Even if you don't choose to buy,
your data will be sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that most people should opt out smartphone use to the best of
their ability. When non-smartphone options are available, these
options should be favored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, many people use their phones to check the time. Seems
benign enough, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What often ends up happening, however, is that the NOTIFICATION SCREEN
pushes all sorts of info into your attention. This is one way in which
the smartphone is a vector of corporate mind viruses; it attacks you
when you are just waiting for a bus or twiddling your thumbs
distracted from homework or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can tweak the settings on your phone to try to suppress
things like the aforementioned notifications. But even still, you are
having faith that our tech overlords (Apple, Google) are doing what
the smartphone UI wants you to believe you are doing. Behind the
scenes, our tech overlords may instead be creating a profile of you as
a "privacy/security concerned user" and trying to optimize the
marketing of some new product to sell to you&amp;mdash;"APPLE VPN" or
something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Privacy" or "productivity" features shouldn't be trusted. The
operating systems themselves are spyware which you have no control
over. Using a smartphone is entering &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, as is using things
like Google Chrome (and probably MacOS, Windows). Sometimes we have to
enter &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; to get things done, but it is not the world we are
native to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tasks where no smart phone is required, not using a smart phone is
preferable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telling time&lt;/strong&gt;: look at a clock/watch; analyze shadows cast on the ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarm clocks, timers, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;: alarm clocks, timers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout&lt;/strong&gt;: stopwatch, friends/coaches/etc.; book/guides/lists on routines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculator&lt;/strong&gt;: learn some mental arithmetic; this is literally
  elementary school level math&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;: paper is fine; dedicated electronic dictionary; PC
  application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps&lt;/strong&gt;: A sense of direction, paper maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding foods&lt;/strong&gt;: just walk into a restaurant and try it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt;: Use this as an opportunity to talk with someone (like
  the British do) &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to give your smartphone &lt;em&gt;as little viewing time as
possible&lt;/em&gt;. When it is time to smartphone, then dive in and smartphone
all the way. But do not kinda smartphone throughout the whole
day. That is a road to misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A good investment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I dislike smartphones, I must admit one place in which they
are extremely efficient economically. This is as a "content creation"
tool for those involved in social media business.  Many people buy
lots of stuff they do not really use, but typically, when people
purchase smart phones they use them &lt;em&gt;a whole lot&lt;/em&gt;. For those that
specialize in bending other people's minds through smartphones, the
smartphone is of course an indispensible tool to use and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also people that specialize in selling cigarettes and
convincing people to join malicious organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not your device&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be tools, but they are tools that are very often far
outside our control. Think &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware"&gt;John Deere
tractors&lt;/a&gt;
(more generally the "&lt;strong&gt;right to repair&lt;/strong&gt;"), but worse because
smartphones are so widespread and are less domain specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are about &lt;em&gt;constraining&lt;/em&gt; users to a certain (small) sets
of actions. Automation is not practically possible for smartphone use
because it is the phone that is supposed to be smart, &lt;em&gt;not you&lt;/em&gt;. Your
job is to populate other people/companies' servers with useful for
data for &lt;em&gt;their ends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you opt to use your smartphone less and consciously do actions
you &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; when you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; decide to use your smartphone, you take control
of your attention and by extension... your LIFE. Shove your smartphone
into a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/faraday-bag/s?k=faraday+bag"&gt;Faraday bag&lt;/a&gt; when you are not using it and laugh as the battery
drains. Today is YOUR DAY to seize.&lt;/p&gt;

communication have changed during my life thus far, highlighting ways
in which current "high tech" ways of doing things have empowered small
groups of (technocratic) elites and the parties that pressure them to
push their (socio-political) agendas while undermining the well-being
of people who just want to build communities with their families
and friends while having some fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The evolution of information delivery pipelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a millennial (born in 1992), I recall a time when Internet access
was limited; it was a new and exciting "high tech" thing and having
access to computers was a kind of status symbol. Zoomers&amp;mdash;born
and raised surrounded by Internet connected technologies&amp;mdash;did not
experience the transaction from the "pre-Internet" world to the
"Digital Age" just as most millennials don't have the experiences that
lead many Boomers to become globalism embracing hippies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that overall, the expansion of the Internet (c.f. THE MATRIX)
has led to a much more &lt;strong&gt;fragile&lt;/strong&gt; world in the sense any one group's
decisions can have
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEA33bAXyNM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hyuuuuuuuuuuuuuge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
consequences. Effectively, this means that propaganda is more
effective and faster acting. Like a machine gun versus a hunting
rifle. Frightening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The reach of news&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 20th century, people often got news through the "legacy media"
in forms like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newspapers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magazines (e.g. Time magazine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broadcast media (television, radio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These forms of "legacy media" are non-interactive in the sense that
they don't have something like &lt;em&gt;comments&lt;/em&gt; sections that give instant
feedback. You could call into a talk show or something, but
participating in things like this is not the default behavior of most
listeners&amp;mdash;most people
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lurk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lurk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
actively observe but not contribute content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, there was news everywhere even before my time&amp;mdash;for
instance in the 1980s, I imagine there were lots of TV broadcasts
running in corporate break rooms, dentists' offices certainly had lots
of magazines, super markets put tabloids near the front of the
store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, news media was not as &lt;em&gt;pushy&lt;/em&gt; as it is now on the
Internet. You could simply avert your gaze and look at something else;
nowadays, getting rid of news, advertisements, etc. often takes some
technical know-how and complex configuration&amp;mdash;it is not something
that can done instinctually with no training. The channels of
information in which news is delivered are required for daily (urban)
living: students must use web browsers to interact with their schools
and complete assignments, many companies are moving towards
electronic-only "paperwork", etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerd aside&lt;/strong&gt;: This trend has invaded even privacy + free information
concerned spaces.  A recent-ish annoying thing is that the Firefox web
browser pushed news stories onto their default home
page&amp;mdash;alienating nerds who had chosen firefox to avoid things
like this that happen on browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social interactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News sitting in web browsers is non-threatening enough. But what about
wearing an advertisement on your forehead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much of what is being normalized in what I will call
&lt;strong&gt;corporate mediated communication&lt;/strong&gt;, using communications technology
(such as messenging apps) where corporate interests are pushed on the
user. This is perhaps the biggest problem I am seeing with information
technology today. One-on-one communication reaks of third party
intervention!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some context&amp;mdash;besides face to face conversations, the
pre-Internet channels for communication include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone calls (LAN line means ur mom could be eavesdropping)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letters/postcards (relatively long form; you have to pay money to send)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other solutions, e.g. leaving notes on the refrigerator, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these media feel particularly "corporate". Sure, you probably
have to work with a company to get your phone line set up, but then
after that, you are largely left alone&amp;mdash;we'll assume nobody is
tapping your wire for now, ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so with smartphones/apps and most (desktop) online experiences!  I
leave Candy Crush installed in Windows 10 so that when I open the
Start menu, I can be reminded that I am in THE MATRIX. When you open
your (smart)phone, unless you flipped a bunch of options, you are
probably greeted by all sorts of news. Android pushes a lot of Google
news and stuff at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these things, if only for an instant, &lt;em&gt;colors our
conversations&lt;/em&gt;. Google/Apple/etc. seizes a bit of our attention before
we started chatting with our friends/family, listening to music, etc.
We may &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we aren't paying attention to these things, but the
headlines and stuff stick&amp;mdash;we get the sense that "the whole world
is doing XYZ"... ...big corporations are determining the contexts of
our conversations by setting mood lighting to their robo-desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Locked Down, Locked In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people are having fewer face-to-face conversations (because they
are not going out), more and more acts of communication
("conversations") are being carried out through corporate-mediated
communications technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevailing narratives such as "END OF WORLD", "TRUMP BAD", "CHINESE
VIRUS", etc. infect people's thinking as tech companies troll our
minds by constantly telling us &lt;em&gt;what to think about&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you open a tool box, your hammer may suggest hitting nails to you,
but that is about it. A piano sitting in your living room may suggest
"you should practice", but it doesn't say "think about XYZ; should we
do military intervention?!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made some conscious decisions about how I set up my tech, I am
relatively well off standing back and analyzing what's going on with
the news and stuff. But I don't expect this of most
people&amp;mdash;especially if they are busy doing important work like
saving people as medical workers or keeping our (already crumbling)
infrastructure from totally collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current attitude is to low-key hate smartphones specifically, but a
lot of the "information ecosystem" more broadly, and avoid invasive
technologies most of the time. Nonetheless, I recognize that these
technologies are ubiquitous things and that I can't get away with not
using one (at least until I have a family of my own, some land,
etc). I was born and raised in THE MATRIX and I must do my part to
help those still in it. So I am doing things like this... writing blog
posts to share my thoughts to hopefully help at least some people see
what is going on with information delivery and then make better
informed decisions about things rather than accept the terrible
"default settings" which we are naively handed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Channeling *Chuunibyou*</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/channeling-chuunibyou.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-25T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-25:/pelican-test/channeling-chuunibyou.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;With great immaturity comes great power.

delusional behavior in general.&lt;/p&gt;

you truly believed you had some sort of super-natural powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;With some imagination, your daily activities become heroic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a student, a lowly corporate wage slave, or otherwise falling
into line to conform to societal norms may be not always be the most
fun thing in the world. Inject some immature thinking, however, and
the every day routine can become lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Desk jobs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to work a bunch of little programs is like knowing how to
cast a bunch of spells. Chaining them together to create solutions,

("delegation").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try something for a while, for instance solving some problem or
reading a chapter of a book. Sooner or later, it will become too
boring/difficult to continue. So, I'll switch to another activity that
I think I should be doing. Repeatedly cycling through different
activities I should be doing, I end up "clocking in" lots of time
doing productive stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workout (e.g. pushup sets, crunches)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign language study (e.g. read some news in Chinese, review some
  Spanish grammar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuss with some Linux config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse over the documentation for some programing language (mostly
  Node, Golang, bash these days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to solve some fussy CSS problem &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing blog posts (like this one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing some &lt;em&gt;Étude&lt;/em&gt; on some musical instrument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the individual activities above often is not the most fun
thing in the world to do. But the variety of being able to cycle
through them means lots of little sessions of intense focus. I lower
my expectations for myself by only expecting to concentrate for like
20 minutes at a time. Workout bursts are even shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sundown I'm usually adequately tired (or interested in something)
that I don't need to ask myself about what to do next. If I feel like
sleeping at 9 PM, sure, I'll go to sleep. If I wanna stay up reading
about how Arab Nationalism didn't work, sure I'll go do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcomed Interruptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punctuating the above routine with sending/receiving a message or two,
looking at the whatever noise I heard outside, flipping through some
book, etc. keeps me feeling "in the loop".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something something &lt;em&gt;flow like water&lt;/em&gt; uhh... zen... yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

Stew", it consisted of whatever ingredients were available, served
with some rice. Ah! The taste of &lt;em&gt;austerity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, it didn't taste excellent, but that's how stuff goes. Every
meal every time doesn't need to be excellent; sometimes we just have
better/worse ingredients available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cooking experience reminds me of something I am trying to do in
other domains of life. That is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Don't be a hipster"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;똑바로 해&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting comfortable with standard tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, there have been different &lt;em&gt;schools&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;styles&lt;/em&gt; of
cooking. Different regions of planet earth had different ingredients
available, different cultural taboos, etc. And so cuisines developed
around core ingredients and time-tested methods to make those
ingredients taste good, kill disease, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking is very daunting if you are always jumping around trying to
make this-and-that culture's ingredients. You may even find yourself
buying specialized tools for all sorts of specific tasks (e.g. a torch
thing for &lt;em&gt;Crème brûlée&lt;/em&gt;, a fancy wok for some South Chinese style
stir-fry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, it pays to learn some standard tools well in other
domains. Jumping around and chasing diversity ("spreading yourself too
thin") is &lt;em&gt;no bueno&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer&lt;/strong&gt;: lots of unix things; computer science fundamentals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;: Look at common, well-regarded music. Don't get lost in
  equipment. Focus on core skills...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Languages&lt;/strong&gt;: standard usage; common colloquial stuff (don't go down
  rabbit hole of dialects and stuff unless you have a specific social
  reason to do so)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the "vanilla" defaults well gives you more freedom because you
can only make variations of the "default" when you &lt;em&gt;first know the
default&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literary Aside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What good are novels/movies/etc. flipping over narratives left and
right when the main audience no longer knows the default narrative?
The overly flipped narratives become the default narrative. And
suddenly the old dusty book has the edgy take.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>The Third-Person Self Improvement Program</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/the-third-person-self-improvement-program.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-23T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-23:/pelican-test/the-third-person-self-improvement-program.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Imagine yourself from a &lt;em&gt;third person perspective&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;watch

&lt;h2&gt;Visualization Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you &lt;em&gt;see the money?!?!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lots of popular psychology and business type books, you will see
discussions of various flavors of &lt;strong&gt;visualization&lt;/strong&gt; techniques. That
is, imagining various scenarios. The idea is that your sub-conscious
will then come up with ideas of how to arrive at these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unscientific? Nonsense? Bullshit? I think, not so much. It is hard to
quantify/measure the efficacy of techniques like visualization. But
the fact that so many people have been using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Recipe for Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you sit down and visualize yourself just philosophizing and
getting nothing done for hours on end? Chances are, you probably
cannot sustain this meditation for long. When I try this, my attention
drifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the weather going to be like tomorrow? Oh.. must take a note
on something I want to write about later. My butt itches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualization techniques get you thinking about what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;
do. What are the available actions I can do? What tools do I have at
my disposal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quarantined Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's LARPing time. You are in an RPG called life. Your character is
trapped for some time in a small dungeon. How will you train? What
skills will you level up? What connections will you make? Options are
many, and time (unlike Federal Reserve notes) is limited.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 2</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-22:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reporting again from self-quarantine, your independent media 👋 Today

&lt;p&gt;First things first …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reporting again from self-quarantine, your independent media 👋 Today
we are going to do some more armchair sociology and
psychologizing. Buckle up ("Click it or Ticket") and grab your
favorite face cover, things are about to get sneezy. Might even add
some abstractions and philosophy to the mix...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, let's define a term: &lt;strong&gt;belief&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regarding "Belief"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English, we have this word "believe" which is quite peculiar. It
has &lt;em&gt;strong religious connotations&lt;/em&gt;. Many would say the question of
whether or not someone is a Christian ultimately comes down to a
question of &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;. But what exactly does it mean to "believe"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to look at "belief" is to see it as a &lt;em&gt;publicly alignment&lt;/em&gt; to
some cause. That is, one goes out in public and makes some
assertion. They are bound to their word.  This way of looking at
belief makes a lot of sense because it has to deal with contracts and
stuff, which America has a lot of maybe mostly owing to British
origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at "belief" is to evaluate &lt;em&gt;what people do&lt;/em&gt; rather
than &lt;em&gt;what people say&lt;/em&gt;. Truly, if you believed your house was fire,
you would do something about it, wouldn't you? By this definition of
belief, we have to prove that we believe something by how we act. From
certain stated axioms, do your actions (rationally) follow? If not,
our actions reveal what we
&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually"&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now given two senses of the word "belief", I will proceed to
characterize the crises of belief currently befalling many of the
people of planet earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State of Disbelief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of the senses of the word "belief" above, we see that we are
collectively in a &lt;strong&gt;state of disbelief&lt;/strong&gt;. You probably can see the pun
I am making with the word "state" too 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we see people making all sorts of assertions about
the state of the world, what's going on. Then we look at what people
are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person might be able to perfectly recite some &lt;strong&gt;ideology&lt;/strong&gt;, giving
the "right answers" by basic logic + mental algebra. But when that
ideology doesn't line up with reality, we see what that person really
&lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; in the second sense I gave above&amp;mdash;their actions
manifest where their real convictions lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such behavior is sometimes can be called "hypocrisy", but I often see
it as more of a struggle to reconcile a collapsing world view. Maybe
"managing cognitive dissonance" or something like that for many
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Theory Shmeary!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everyone and their favorite non-profit is trying to push some
ideology, it is not surprising that people often hold many incoherent
"beliefs" when taken together as declarations of belief. One might at
one time utter the words,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open borders! No kids in cages!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed borders! Keep everyone safe, Drumpf is an overconfident idiot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free market! We need everyone to have goods/services no matter the cost!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government rationing of supplies! Planned economy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and this is because these statements are taken from disjoint
self-contained systems (though not necessarily so). One person can say
them all; we are not computers that blow up if there is some "logical
contradiction".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My analysis is that these things people say belong to the first sense
of &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;publically making known one's adherence to some
words. One might analyze this as a sort of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act"&gt;speect
act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Globalists x NeoLiberals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One class of people I see getting hit hard are the relatively
&lt;strong&gt;xenophilic&lt;/strong&gt; ("foreign-stuff loving") types. These folks often like
to celebrate how people/places/cultures that are not them are
great. Imagine learning some foreign language of a people/culture you
do not belong to (oh no, I see my reflection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see many of these folks turning inward, displaying their true
colors. It is not about diversity and decentralization of power
(e.g. competing US, European Union, Chinese, Russian, Pan-Indic,
Islamic forces vying for power...), it is about issuing in a
"democratic world order" in which the world is a zoo of cultures to
visit with a German (not to be confused with &lt;em&gt;Nazi&lt;/em&gt;, mind you)
passport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they announce is that they embrace diversity, respect other
cultures, etc. What their actions show they &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; is that they
have all the right answers and that these things should be exported at
the point of a gun to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the astute can see through the ideological &lt;strong&gt;virtue
signalling&lt;/strong&gt; of people saying how tolerant, diversity embracing, blah
blah they are. Such behavior made sense to climb up corporate ladders
and stuff in the pre-COVID-19 world. But when institutions shut down
and do not intervene between reality, shit hits the fan with &lt;em&gt;no
intervening toilet paper&lt;/em&gt;. The horror!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Traditionalists vs Revolutionaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people really like ritual, and just do stuff just because. I'll
call them &lt;strong&gt;traditionalists&lt;/strong&gt;. They may tell you that they don't need
a reason for doing what they are doing, they just do.  Insofar as
these people are able to keep up their traditions, they seem pretty
chill through all this quarantine business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditionalist doesn't need to explain at every step. They act in
a way that has led to survival in the past. The traditionalist
&lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; tradition will allow them to weather this storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let is call the opposite of traditionalist a
&lt;strong&gt;revolutionary&lt;/strong&gt;. Revolutionaries want to overturn tradition and
forge a new path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, being a "revolutionary" in a left-wingy sense has become
quite... mainstream. So we see lots of self-proclaimed left wingers
doing things like voting for Joe Biden. Voting to &lt;em&gt;conserve the
establishment&lt;/em&gt;. Lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the idea of the "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority"&gt;silent
majority&lt;/a&gt;" makes sense
to me. We see people who make the gestures of "revolutionaries" at
times, campaigning for social justice and all. But in the end, they
are establishment mongers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's OK in my book; you don't choose everything about who you are,
including dispositions towards certain behvaiors. I hope your
"revolutionary" comrades do treat you alright though if you fall into
this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So... what's your point?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we see many mismatches between word and deed all around us
everyday. In a time of crisis, like with impending
&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/corona-chan"&gt;Corona&lt;em&gt;-chan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is
evermore easy to see the "raw belief" of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not condemn widespread hypocrisy around me. Rather I observe a
struggle to resolve ideologies&amp;mdash;often fragmented and incomplete,
consisting of collected sayings (c.f. Confucian &lt;em&gt;Analects&lt;/em&gt;). People
are being tested for what they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe in the sense that
they are being forced into action. Certain actions reveal a mismatch
between proclaimed ideology and assessment of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think it is important to not get too fixated on witch
hunting based on proclaimed ideology because many people around the
world just proclaim what they do to stay alive. Much of China says
"yes communism!" because they didn't want to die; now they are acting
in a very much "yes fascism!" way in the sense that we see a marriage
of government and industry... PUNCH ALL CHINESE BECAUSE THEY ARE
FACISTS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bruh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other languages aside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other languages have lots of words (and even grammatical structure) to
discuss all things &lt;strong&gt;epistemological&lt;/strong&gt; (having to do with what
&lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; and what is &lt;em&gt;knowable&lt;/em&gt;, see
&lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/"&gt;SPE&lt;/a&gt; for more
info).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish has a word &lt;em&gt;confiar&lt;/em&gt; which might sometimes be used in contexts
similar to "believe". But this word is also often translated as things
like "trust" (as in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; in the process&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The East Asian languages have translations from missionaries of words
in the Bible dealing with belief. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 1</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-20:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In contemporary times, Japanese people are famous being good at

heard that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/5huKA_11/status/1237687423687155713"&gt;Japan was running out of toilet
paper&lt;/a&gt; and
that there were issues with people hoarding and buying out stores, I
knew that there was going to be trouble. Although my inner-prepper had
already led me to prep with things like things canned foods,
fire-starting devices, and knives (for cooking and chopping up
plants), it became clear to me that preparing more couldn't hurt. So
while stuff was still in stock, I went out and bought some more
essentials. At this point in the virus explosion timeline, everything
in the US was running as usual. COVID-19 (then sometimes called "Wuhan
Virus") &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; in the mainstream news, but businesses were still open
and running as usual. I think the stock market took some little dips,
but nothing major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom ahead a few weeks, and we see major market crashing action, Joe
Biden leading the Democrats, and some areas of the world (e.g. Italy)
hit very hard. Optimists say to expect maybe three more weeks of this,
but the inner &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doomer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doomer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
within each of us knows to expect more chaos for longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not too long ago finished filing taxes, so I didn't go sell off
all my stocks. I didn't wanna think about markets, government
intervention, and everything in between. Then the Federal Reserve
money printers started whirring. &lt;em&gt;brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Invisible Enemies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the news through all of this has been a bullshit filtering
exercise of great proportion. The scientifically minded are a bit more
comfortable with just &lt;em&gt;how little we know&lt;/em&gt;, but this is not the case
for the public at large. People turn every which way for
&lt;em&gt;authority&lt;/em&gt;. Some turn to popular personalities, others to
governments, and yet others to corporate e-mail announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one common thread that I see running through all these
reactions.  In the words of President Donald Trump, we're fighting an
&lt;strong&gt;"invisible enemy"&lt;/strong&gt;. Each person has constructed a different "invisible
enemy", though none can deny the chaos befalling our dear globalist
order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Containment Measures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you like... can't see a virus with the naked eye. So in a
very literal sense, we are fighting an "invisible enemy" since we
can't see viruses. I hope you are doing your part to not be part of
the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "invisible enemy" does not immediately manifest itself. Even
breathing the same air as a healthy looking person can potentially
mean infection. The orders to practice &lt;strong&gt;"social distancing"&lt;/strong&gt; thus
urge people to not just avoid overtly coughting and weezing humans
around them, but to generally avoid breathing the same air as others
since we &lt;em&gt;don't know who may be infected&lt;/em&gt;. This is how we try to
contain the spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mostly-remote web developer, practicing "social distancing"
hasn't been much of a change for me in terms of day-to-day
lifestyle. However, as businesses continue closing their doors and
governments have begun issuing "shelter in place" orders, even my
already rather isolated remote life is being affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not yet know anyone personally who is infected with the virus,
though I expect I probably will in the near future. I plan to consider
taking quarantine stuff seriously. In terms of &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; goals (as
opposed to &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; goals like avoiding sickness and death) I intend
to do more pushups, squats, and crunches on the dungeon floor as well
as skipping rope in the corner of my yard. Current hobbies continue to
be studying foreign languages, doing computer nerd stuff, and
occasionally trying to make pleasant sounds on musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing for young-ish healthy people to do, I think, is to
&lt;em&gt;respect the enemy (virus)&lt;/em&gt; and to not "YOLO, whatever I'm traveling
to Italy!". This is mainly out of concern for others, though it may
very likely be a life-saving alignment for oneself. Those who have the
power to not end up in the hospital should choose to not end up in the
hospital so that those that need help can get it. Plus, it is no fun
to go to the hospital, but I didn't have to tell you that probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fanning the flames of ethnic tensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mainstream media's response to COVID-19 has also done much to fan
the flames of existing tensions. I see my ethnic demographic
(&lt;strong&gt;Asian-Americans&lt;/strong&gt;) getting worked up against (white) people who do
not xenophilically embrace them. Certainly, hostilities exist between
different people groups. Just listen to a second-generation
Chinese-American immigrant mother describe how dirty white people are
for leaving their shoes on in homes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet we (Asian-Americans) are programmed to see micro-aggression in any
vanilla colored smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As COVID-19 rages, we see individuals &lt;em&gt;returning to ethnic enclaves&lt;/em&gt;
(oftentimes families where near everyone is of the same ethnicity). I
don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. But it is worth pointing
out that in times of trial people tend to reveal where their loyalties
really lie. Narratives of persecution &lt;em&gt;have not helped Americans
towards further solidarity with one another&lt;/em&gt;. Rather, they have
encouraged people to dig deeper into their
Semitic/Chinese/Indian/etc. tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also see people withdrawing into philosophical/intellectual (rather
than ethnic) camps. Groups of people united by something like a common
profession (e.g. programers) or a shared ideology (e.g. "secular
humanists") band may be able to survive together, at least for one
generation. However I believe that in the long run, ethnic and/or
religious affiliations are a more robust strategy, because
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neckbeard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;neckbeards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
cannot give birth to new generations with other neckbeards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Religion Rising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing institutional incomeptence, religion is looking healthier
overall from what I can see. People want to see other people and
communities. They would rather pray to God than see what demonic
bargains the governments of the world have to offer them next. The
promise of liberalism and globalism seems less appealing, even if the
Kingdom of Heaven cannot be known except through faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online social lyfe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these tough times, we must recognize our nature as a "social
species" (though I think individuals differ drastically on how much
social contact they want).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm around if you contact me on FB, LINE, Kakao, or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more "public" like experience, I've been very impressed with
Discord. Come hang out with me and others on the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/2RFwR7R"&gt;Xah Lee
Discord&lt;/a&gt; server to meet interesting people
from all over the world and talk about anything under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes to self&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole boatload (non-infected, I hope) of topics to discuss
relating to all this coronavirus stuff. Here I list some things I want
to discuss further in the future. Feel free to reach out and suggest
ideas if you would like to see a discussion on anything...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This review &lt;em&gt;contains no spoilers&lt;/em&gt;. I'm mainly discussing major
gameplay things you'll be able see within ten minutes of playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you trust someone who doesn't drink coffee to give you reviews
of the local cafés? Probably not. Let me tell you a bit about myself
and my gaming history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I am a Casual&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't play games competitively whatsoever. I briefly tried to climb
in LoL, but I sucked and remained in Bronze where I originally placed,
lol. I am a &lt;em&gt;casual&lt;/em&gt;. So here I am, reviewing a game series I played
through on &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; mode. Me, a &lt;strong&gt;normie&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I take a long time to play through games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, when I go through some game, I play like 3-7 times per a
week in around 1-2 hour sessions. That being said, it takes a while
for me to finish playing through any game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Races, Classes, Etiquettes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting aspect of the Shadowrun games is the way characters
are built. Building interesting characters is one the main reasons
people would play an
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Races&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software"&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt;"
humans and then there are "metahumans": trolls, orcs, dwarves, elves.
Using different (fictional) races like this allows the game creators
to introduce low-key "&lt;strong&gt;race realism&lt;/strong&gt;" into this game. Some races are
more/less charismatic than others, other races are physically
stronger/weaker. These discussions needn't be &lt;em&gt;hateful&lt;/em&gt; of course;
rather the player must ask themselves, how do I navigate this
diversity that I never asked for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as with other fictional universes, you can safely explore the
notion of "race" in Shadowrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Classes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate, I typically received the same sort of reaction
when I said I was majoring in Philosophy (and Chinese, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
"Chinese Philosophy" mind you). Namely, people asked "wtf are you
gonna do with that?" A valid question, ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadowrun is similar&amp;mdash;except you choose a general &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; for
your character, and typically build up attributes/abilities (by
spending &lt;em&gt;karma&lt;/em&gt; points) that match your character's affinities. As in
real life, your resources are limited, so if you try to spread your
development too thin (like yours truly), you may quickly end up the
"jack of all trades, but the master of none". However, as you hyper
focus, there are also &lt;strong&gt;diminishing marginal returns&lt;/strong&gt;, with each
increasing of an existing ability/attribute you have being more
expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus to build a strong character (in terms of game mechanics), you
have to strike a balance between spcializing (and unlocking very
powerful abilities) and building yourself a broad palette of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Etiquettes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Shadowrun, you choose an "etiquette", like Corporate, Security,
Gang... Basically this is social know-how for some type of community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this pretty relevant to real life; you may, for example, be a
straight-A student, but a total idiot on the streets. Likewise, you
may be excellent at writing cover letters for LinkedIn, but you may
suck at creating cheery conversation buzz with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building a character, you can optionally get cyber-body upgrades
like plastic coating for your skin and such. Each upgrade consumes
"essence" of your body; you cannot completely replace yourself with
robo-parts! For you nerds that like "deep thoughts", check out some
thought experiments in "&lt;strong&gt;Philosophy of Mind&lt;/strong&gt;". You can sip wine with
your pinky up while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The cyberpunk aesthetic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason I can see for playing Shadowrun is to enjoy immersive
role playing. For tactical strategy greatness, fast-paced action,
studying Japanese, or whatever you might wanna do, there are probably
better options. But for running around sprawling urban concrete
jungles causing mischief, these games are pretty fun. Would recommend
and play again!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Fun"></category></entry><entry><title>"Propaganda" as a Descriptive Term</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/propaganda-as-a-descriptive-term.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-26:/pelican-test/propaganda-as-a-descriptive-term.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;propaganda&lt;/strong&gt; is often used as a kind of slur.

people use propaganda, including people you likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a definition.&lt;/p&gt;

people use propaganda, including people you likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is information that is used primarily to influence an
audience and further an agenda, which may not be objective and may
be presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis
or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional
rather than a rational response to the information that is
presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Definition from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wikipedia definition above is kind of
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neckbeard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;neckbeard-y&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in my opinion, but it is good enough to work from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All those brainwashed sheeple!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you imagine someone in a cult talks? Look at how you and your
in-group(s) signal agreement. Look at what you begin with as
assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not time to bicker about philosophical this-or-that everyday,
so everyone has to take some assumptions about how the world works and
run with that. In some environments, it may more-or-less match up with
the real world. Consider "scientific" thinking; most people most of
the time just take what they are on authority, just like religious
people. Those "marching for science" are not much different from
people at a religious rally. They both assume they are right, and they
are publically displaying their devotion to their ideological cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you do stuff in the real world, you most certainly operate in
social circumstances that more or less force you to acknowledge
certain things as true. Propaganda reinforces these axioms that create
social-cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How we use propaganda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is everywhere and it can be very useful, not just for
controlling others but for controlling ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is super useful for doing things like reaching goals. Goals
are often defined in terms propaganda taught us. Consider listening to
a "work out" playlist. The music you are listening to is &lt;em&gt;literally
mind control waves&lt;/em&gt;, putting you in a kind of rhythmic trance and
making you wanna go show off your enw fit body at the club or
whatever. This can be incredibly motivating for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Reinforcement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, propaganda is useful for signalling in-group
preference. Posting such and such image can signal that you are "one
of the boys" in some group. A mistake can show affiliations you were
trying to hide. The more socialized you are in some group, the better
you are able to recognize insiders and outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dark Arts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to understanding the &lt;strong&gt;Dark Arts&lt;/strong&gt; is to realize the
darkness within yourself. Learn how propaganda operates in your life
already and then you can start to help others defend against it. You
may also choose to channel the dark energy for your benefit, as you
come to understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Use Browser Navigation</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/use-browser-navigation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-26:/pelican-test/use-browser-navigation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Built into all browsers these days are buttons like FORWARD, BACK, and

REFRESH. However, many web developers choose to build navigation
components into their sites which ignore this built in functionality.
The result is UI &lt;strong&gt;bloat&lt;/strong&gt;. There are multiple back buttons displayed
for most users, both those on screen and those on the browser
itself. Rather than having content quickly and cleanly delivered, we
are faced with all-looking-the-same websites, which are supposedly
user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual users can do things to get rid of browser clutter. However,
most people aren't nerds who tweak their browser settings to hide
things they don't want (or who set up stuff like &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; keybindings for
their browser).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content First&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making use of browser buttons instead of cluttering a UI with your own
buttons puts your &lt;em&gt;content first&lt;/em&gt;. Navigating your web pages should be
non-annoying, but is not the main reason people (should) visit your
website. Hopefully you have something useful to offer that pretty
menus and spinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Peripheral friendliness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other advantage of making use of normal BACK/FORWARD functionality
is that many keyboards and mice (as well as other things, like game
controllers) can be set up to access these functions on convenient
thumb-buttons and other more ergonomic fixtures. Save your ass
expensive medical bills from &lt;b&gt;RSI&lt;/b&gt; and stuff and build for the
future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Action plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to write many web pages that you have to use your browser
navigation to get away from. No need to write another "back" button if
you can just press back. No layers of abstraction above normal browser
navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other technical notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern web tech like &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; piles on some layers of abstraction
through things like &lt;strong&gt;dynamic routing&lt;/strong&gt; with tools like &lt;strong&gt;React
router&lt;/strong&gt; to implement forward-back functionality in &lt;strong&gt;Single Page
Applications&lt;/strong&gt; (SPA). This is understandable for making snappy web
pages that feel "modern".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you don't load too many images and other media, keep
things clean and simple, etc., web pages don't even take that long to
load. This blog, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry><entry><title>No Glasses Meditation</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/no-glasses-meditation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-18T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-18:/pelican-test/no-glasses-meditation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try something for some time.

&lt;p&gt;Musical instruments, stringed ones in particular have many features of
a good ergonomic keyboard layout. Since spending some more time
studying music more seriously, I've lost interest in optimizing
typing. I used to type Dvorak (got over 100 WPM), but have since
switched &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; to standard QWERTY, the default of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the (physical) input of what you are doing is reflected in the
(physical) output, it feels good. Computer keyboards will always be
characterized by arbitrariness because there is a lot of chaos in
writtelanguage. Even if by chance a keyboard was designed where the
arrangement of letters somehow matched some phonetic properties or
something like that, this wouldn't necessarily translate to a nice
typing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing stringed instruments is tactically satisfying because the
inputs you apply (bowing, picking, etc.) translate immediately into
the sounds produced. Even looking at different ways of tuning a guitar
(e.g. standard EADGBE versus DADGAD), the "logic" of fretting to get
higher pitched sounds remains. The layout of the instrument (and
therefore the "inputs" it takes) will always be reflected in the
sounds produced. Keyboard instruments typically do this, but I guess
you could program a synthesizer to behave more arbitrarily if you
really wanted to... but why? Just type to experience that chaos!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Fun"></category></entry><entry><title>Yang Gang 2020 Aftermath</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/yang-gang-2020-aftermath.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-12T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-12T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-12:/pelican-test/yang-gang-2020-aftermath.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang stopped his campaign some time around today.

either. Here's I share some thoughts about Yang's political
messages/campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First are some impressions/observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yang campaigned hard on &lt;strong&gt;Universal Basic Income&lt;/strong&gt;, $1000 bucks a
  month for pretty much all adults in a certain age range&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I accept Yang's point that this is probably a better
  redistribution scheme than other existing programs, layers and
  layers of bureaucracy, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would not like to see the government expand; it is unclear to
  me if Yang's Freedom Divident (aka &lt;strong&gt;NEET bux&lt;/strong&gt;) would be
  accompanied by cutting government spending elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If UBI were to come to be, I'd expect a proliferation of
  subsisting people living ant-style (&lt;em&gt;ari-zoku&lt;/em&gt;) for free; talk
  about danger for epidemics! A specialized class of rent-farmers
  would likely thrive too... (speculation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yang's race/ethnicity is a whatever to me&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But I see you racialists out there choosing Yang just because
  he's "of color" or "Asian" just like people chose Obama for
  similar reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think that there are both people more inclined to vote for
  Yang &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; he's Asian, and also people who would choose not
  to because of that... ...or maybe it's more about him appealing
  to the "nerd" demographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk of the threat of Artificial Intelligence and climate change
  without talk about populations/demographics gets the noggin' joggin'&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should governments decide which groups to subsidize (and
  hence increase) at the expense of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Insert Leftist critiques of big oil, tobacco industries, and
  related topics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yang appears to me to be a pretty good guy, and a sincere person. In
this way, I think he has a trustworthy "feel" like Sanders. However, I
do believe his policies in general would drive America to be worse and
worse; sorry Ayn Rand brainwashed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dichotomous Political Opinions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;, I like how Yang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criticizes the inefficiency of government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has a scheme to allow capitalism, but with some safety net&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see how people relate UBI to "classical liberal" thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rouses &lt;strong&gt;swamp-drainy&lt;/strong&gt; thoughts and criticisms of the &lt;strong&gt;legacy
   media&lt;/strong&gt; on the Dem side (search term &lt;strong&gt;yang media blackout&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;left&lt;/strong&gt;, I like how Yang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a redistributionist scheme that &lt;em&gt;is more universal than
   anything we've seen before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems relatively peaceful, not war-hawky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open the Third Eye; Optics and Meta-Cognitive Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike the 'MATH' campaign thing and all that nerd stuff; I see
that Yang is a lawyer too, not an engineer or even a veteran
(C.f. Tulsi Gabbard) so I suspect how "in touch" with reality he is on
the physics of the world. Math is wallowing in abstractions; how does
this map to reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't matter to most people who just clamour against "CLIMATE
CHANGE" and view they have "SCIENCE" on their side without
understanding a thing about it, besides what they've heard, akin to
how most people accept the traditions/religions handed to them.
(&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm not denying climate change or criticizing
traditions/religions here, I'm just making a point about how people
accept/reject ideas presented to them...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The memes were with him...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(...but many were probably by top-down design)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I hope that this whole Yang ordeal encoruages people to
criticially evaluate the sources they get any information from.&lt;/p&gt;

   user profile as you can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;train Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; to be more useful to you: e.g. use
   Facebook to study a foreign language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding Facebook is a &lt;strong&gt;marketable skill&lt;/strong&gt;: particularly,
   managing ad campaigns, administering pages, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that can manage not being totally addicted to Facebook, I
think it is a decently good idea to reclaim Facebook as &lt;em&gt;your public
facing platform&lt;/em&gt;. Facebook is now a rather established platform that
offers many useful services. Approaching Facebook purposefully, you
can leverage it to be an overall good thing in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't be a coward, show your face!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many places on the Internet where users communicate with
(relative) anonymity, hiding behind an anime profile picture, an image
of a cute dog/cat, some meme character, etc.  Certainly, there are
cases where anonymity is useful, notably for &lt;strong&gt;whistleblowers&lt;/strong&gt; or
other individuals who &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be anonymous for their own safety.  I
support the creation and maintenance of places for people to
communicate anonymously (and oppose "deplatforming" in the USA where I
live, generally), but I don't think they are good for most people most
of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some general points about how anonymity can lead to bad
behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little to no "&lt;strong&gt;skin in the game&lt;/strong&gt;" causes people to speak
  recklessly or to take actions that can hurt others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escapism&lt;/strong&gt; is encouraged; &lt;strong&gt;accountability&lt;/strong&gt; is avoided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trends&lt;/strong&gt; are more difficult to assess; prolific shit-posters may
  inflate the relevance of certain themes, bringing the fringe to the
  mainstream; different information ecosystems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, having a real-world identity linked up with online
interactions encourages people to treat each other more politely and
avoid being overtly nasty as the Internet functions as something of a
public record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a real-world identity online encoruages people to use online
platforms as &lt;em&gt;a gateway to offline interactions&lt;/em&gt;. Logistics can be
handled much more easily if everyone involved is familiar with social
media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of ads and influence (what I like to call "the dark
arts") is a big topic, especially following all the 2016 presidential
election stuff. That being said, a platform like Facebook allows
astute users to observe who is pushing what agenda more
transparently. Ads have to be pushed by someone for something, after
all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control your node&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spoken to friends who at some point or another decided to
"close" their Facebook accounts. To the best of my knowledge, Facebook
makes no promises at ever completely deleting your stuff, so closing
your account is essentially forfeiting control of your node (data representing you on Facebook's &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview"&gt;Graph API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing to keep a Facebook account (even if you don't use it much) is
akin to holding onto property you'd rather have &lt;em&gt;not abused&lt;/em&gt; event if
you aren't actively using it. Particularly for public-facing
individuals, keeping control of Facebook content about you might be a
good idea,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Train Facebook to do what you want&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook's &lt;strong&gt;Feed&lt;/strong&gt; has been the subject of lots of controversy.  Many
things about it are opaque to end users. However, in general, a "what
you put into the surveillance state browser is what you get out of it"
principle seems to hold true for most people I have discussed these
issues with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you log into Google chrome and search for digital camera things on
Amazon, what sort of ads do you expect to see in Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can train Facebook to give you more of what you think you &lt;em&gt;should
be seeing&lt;/em&gt;. For example, if you are trying to do more home cooking,
just go search some cooking stuff. Facebook will probably feed you
lots of interesting inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purposefully use Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I only pick up phone calls if I am expecting a call or if
the number calling is one I recognize. This has saved lots of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching Facebook with a &lt;strong&gt;policy&lt;/strong&gt; like how many people approach
phone calls can allow you to leverage this powerful platform to
enhance your life. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry><entry><title>Why LARBS?</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/why-larbs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-27T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-12-27T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-12-27:/pelican-test/why-larbs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html"&gt;Arch Linux Install for n00bs&lt;/a&gt; I gave details on how to install Arch linux and then suggested &lt;a href="https://larbs.xyz"&gt;LARBS&lt;/a&gt; as a way to get up and running with your new installation.

In this article I detail &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I find LARBS particularly useful and address some points brought up by haters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sensible Defaults&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one reason to use LARBS is to experience with &lt;strong&gt;sensible defaults
for a keyboard centered workflow&lt;/strong&gt;. LARBS offers an out-of-the-box setup of
many nice things that can take a long time to set up manually: a &lt;strong&gt;tiling
window manager&lt;/strong&gt;, vi-like &lt;strong&gt;line editing&lt;/strong&gt; (via zsh), a PDF reader (Zathura).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, LARBS comes bundled with software you probably want: e.g. a
privacy-respecting browser (Brave), git, some programming languages and
compilers. The &lt;code&gt;yay&lt;/code&gt; tool is already setup to help you grab even more software
from Arch Linux's AUR repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Linux users set these things up themselves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical people want good tools readily available to them. If you begin
learning guitar on a really poorly made instrument you are more likely to
become discouraged and give up. On the other hand, if you have a more
experienced friend (or shop) set up your instrument when you are getting
started, you may make a lot more progress, more quickly in &lt;em&gt;actually learning
how to play&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many aspects of installing things randomly often are annoying and
don't involve much learning. The arcane details of how to run some program you
are probably going to run only very rarely are perhaps better offloaded to
automation (e.g. the shell scripts LARBS uses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But using someone else's setup is lame!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LARBS does not constrain how you set things up later---it's just a shell script
to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I use emacs a lot, and Luke Smith (who made LARBS) doesn't. Many
tools in LARBS I don't care about or use (e.g. &lt;code&gt;vifm&lt;/code&gt;, vim-like file manager)
because I just use &lt;code&gt;dired&lt;/code&gt; in emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pros and Cons&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What LARBS is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; good for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if you require applications that require Windows or some other OS, you are out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are doing complicated things with sound, hardware, etc. LARBS only gives a basic desktop setup. It may be much harder to adjust these settings in LARBS compared with a well-established Linux distribution, such as Lubuntu or Manjaro (two others I have tried with older hardware).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to set up typing in CJK; I'm still figuring out how to get this well
integrated and will upload a guide when I am able to do so nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What LARBS &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; good for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LARBS is good for getting a decent general computing and programming
environment set up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a user coming from a more traditional desktop setup, LARBS allows you to
explore ideas like...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiling windows for more efficient screen space usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remapping CAPS LOCK for happier keyboarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editing config files to change settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...without the trouble that might come from tweaking another installation (e.g.
modifying default Ubuntu) or doing everything from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on the one hand, there is definitely learning to be done in &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;
things yourself from the start, why shouldn't we reuse good defaults and stable
software set up by more knowledgable people? Studying the LARBS config files is
a good way to start writing your own configs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanna try out a tilling window manager, just install Arch and LARBS. It
is not even that bad and you can customize it more later as you find out more
about what you want.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting Comfortable with Linux</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/getting-comfortable-with-linux.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-14T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-08-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-08-14:/pelican-test/getting-comfortable-with-linux.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Updated 8/14/2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial aims to answer this question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that I have a Linux system running, how do I go about learning
more?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is aimed at eager beginners and aspiring computer users
that have decided to take control of their computing. It largely
follows my journey to learn more about Linux specifically and
computing more generally. My goal is that with this tutorial and a
handful of things downloaded, you can sit with your
computer&amp;mdash;even without an Internet connection and learn more
about computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach here is thematic; I go over some class of actions you
might want to do, and then mention some options you may choose to
succeed at doing these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I assume that you have a Linux system up and running
(...and here, the term "Linux" is used to mean a UNIX or UNIX-like
system that has certain core utilities, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the kernel itself or
something highly technical like that). For something that just works,
&lt;a href="https://manjaro.org/"&gt;Manjaro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://xubuntu.org/"&gt;Xubuntu&lt;/a&gt;
are some solid options. If you want to spend some more time
configuring things, you may want to try &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/"&gt;installing Arch
Linux&lt;/a&gt;. Really, it
doesn't matter that much where you start because you are entering
Linux land where customizability is king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a samurai without a sword? You need an editor! Most things on
Linux are configurable via a &lt;strong&gt;"dot file"&lt;/strong&gt;, so called because they
have a name that starts with a &lt;em&gt;dot&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;.eslint&lt;/code&gt;...). You will need an editor to change these files. If you
are enthusiastic about learning Linux, you probably have some interest
in writing scripts or programs or some sort. You'll need an editor for
that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning the basics of some editor is a skill you will not
regret. Editors like &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt; can be found pretty much
anywhere. It probably won't be too difficult for you to grab a more
sophisticated editor like &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;emacs&lt;/code&gt;, or Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GUI way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big movement to make Linux systems intuitive and
"user-friendly", particularly for users coming from Windows and
Mac. No explanations needed here&amp;mdash;you can explore the menus and
built in softwares with any Linux distribution that comes built in
with a graphical desktop environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no shame in using and enjoying a GUI. For many things, this
is the easiest way to get things done, particularly if you don't care
to do any special configuration. Examples of things I've recently used
GUI menus to configure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Themes/fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wallpaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joining wifi networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sound/volume stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other tasks, such as managing software, is perhaps better done through
the Command Line Interface (CLI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whispering into the soul of your system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of things on modern computers are "artifacts of engineering",
leftover remnants from designs of the past. One interesting example is
the "command line interface" typically accessed through a &lt;strong&gt;terminal&lt;/strong&gt;
(emulator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers used to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Computer Terminal" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3708/10526021063_a47c368729_b.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more current times, the old way of interacting with computers is
emulated using what is usually called something like "terminal" or
"shell" on modern systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Need moar software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Linux distributions ship with a &lt;strong&gt;package manager&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exploring your filesystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typing stuff like &lt;code&gt;ls -la&lt;/code&gt; all the time can get very tiring. One way
to get around this problem is to define &lt;strong&gt;aliases&lt;/strong&gt; for commands you
commonly use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to get around your file sytem is to use a &lt;strong&gt;file manager&lt;/strong&gt;
that runs on the command line (or within your favorite editor). For
example, there is &lt;a href="https://vifm.info/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;vifm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for doing common
operations like moving, copying, and renaming files in a vim editor
like way. Emacs has the built in
&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dired&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
mode to do these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting system info&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out some quick information about your system and display it in
a pretty way, use your package manager to download and install
&lt;code&gt;screenfetch&lt;/code&gt;. There are of course other places to find all of this
information, but this is the easiest way to getting system info (that
also looks cool) akin to doing the "about my computer" stuff on
Windows or MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding more information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there things that you don't understand? How do you find
documentation for those things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Clicking through menus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often how I learn more about the features of some program. You
may discover useful commands you never thought you needed if you take
the time to click through some menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found this especially helpful in using widely used, large,
complex programs like GIMP (image manipulation) and Blender (3D
graphics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Built-in help systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pieces of software come with their own built in help
systems. Many (most?) users jump to searching the Internet for
answers, but becoming familiar with the built-in help system for some
software may be able to provide quicker, more specific answers if you
invest a little bit of time to learn how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation is often available for download for offline viewing. If
you have a 12 hour flight coming up, why not read a user manual until
you fall asleep? (either way, you win&amp;mdash;you learn something or you
get a good rest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;High quality online resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all websites are created equal; finding the best websites can save
you a lot of time you'd otherwise spend sifting through crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than naïvely Googling how to do something on Linux, for
instance, it may be helpful to first consult the &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"&gt;Arch
Wiki&lt;/a&gt; for Linux related topics. This
resource can be useful even for non-Arch users that want to learn
about some topic and Linux. For instance, recently I wanted to see
what options were available for &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Optical_disc_drive#Ripping"&gt;ripping
CDs&lt;/a&gt;. The
Arch Wiki had lots of helpful information for doing that on my
(non-Arch) Debian-based system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An autobiographical account of using computers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I was introduced to computers&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use specific programs to do specific things. MS word is for
writing papers. MS paint is for having fun making digital
drawings. Photoshop is for more serious digital paintings (and

&lt;h2&gt;An autobiographical account of using computers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I was introduced to computers&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use specific programs to do specific things. MS word is for
writing papers. MS paint is for having fun making digital
drawings. Photoshop is for more serious digital paintings (and
editing photos). Games r fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less, I continued to think this way even after I took my first
introduction to programming class (Java in High School). I was
introduced to programming using Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs); large applications that aim to bring all tools necessary for
writing programs together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, however, I began to take note of the fact that I
could &lt;em&gt;use different programs to edit the same sorts of files&lt;/em&gt;. I
think I started to have these thoughts about graphics software. I
realized I could use various editing softwares to do some task like
&lt;em&gt;resizing an image&lt;/em&gt;. Wow, cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I thought of new things I wanted to do with computers, I became
more interested in software generally (specifically &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; software,
as in &lt;em&gt;free beer&lt;/em&gt; because I didn't have a way to pay for stuff
online). I gradually learned more about programming generally, Linux,
and other related things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this has been a lot of fun. It has also caused some trouble for
me, working with other people and their computers. Could I help
someone do XYZ in Microsoft Word? No, because I was too busy fiddling
with LaTeX or Markdown. I guess I could help them Google it? More
recently, by investing lots of time into learning &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"&gt;GNU
emacs&lt;/a&gt;, I've neglected
to learn many useful things in &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;Microsoft's Visual Studio
Code&lt;/a&gt;, the de facto standard for web
development (my day job) these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this rambling leads us to our main topic of
discussion&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;different approaches to computing&lt;/em&gt; and their
relative pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approaches to Computing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people like me who have messed around with a lot of
programs to do a lot of things and are not so super-good at using any
of them. We have fun with computers, get our work done, and are
excited to play around with new technologies (or rediscover) old ones.
Our abilities scale with effort, enthusiasm, and time. We "waste" a
lot of time on the computer in the sense that if we just stuck with a
few things, we could have gotten by with a lot less scattered know-how
and hours spent fiddling with configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to another type of computer user...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The One Program Wonder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain pieces of software out there are very powerful.  If you can
use certain programs well, you can easily turn your visions in reality
(and find high paying work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people learn a small number of programs extremely well and don't
care about the rest. Consider a digital artist/designer that makes use
of Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. This person has awesome
visual powers. With a Macbook pro and a big idea, they can move
mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person might not know how to write a bash script, set up a
printer, or install an operating system. They may call tech support
for help. Are they n00b? Or, consider the hardcore gamer that
concentrates on one game and plays it very well. They may not know how
to do anything else on a computer, but in their domain they are an
unstoppable force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Just make it werk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there are people that believe that &lt;em&gt;by playing (video) games you
already lose&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people spend as little time with computers as possible. Often,
this works out just fine. These are users who can get away with
replacing a laptop or a desktop computer with a tablet. For these
users, the tablet does everything they would want a computer to do,
plus it is generally cheaper, it is more portable, and perhaps more
durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using mobile devices and tablets, there is often only one way really
to do things. There is a single way to do things like change settings,
enter/exit the application, etc. Often this involves clicking,
touching buttons, etc. For nerds, this may be terrible. They may
literally lose sleep over trying to do something in a way UI/UX
designers don't care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just make it werk" users may just give up with their technology and
go socialize, work out, paint pictures, or do something else with
their time while nerds try to pretend Macbooks are Linux machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-reflection on my after-hours computing habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours, I boot up Linux (see my &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html"&gt;Arch Linux install
guide&lt;/a&gt;),
launch emacs (see my &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/captainalan/d2d94f8ff88ba0c74e85560246d51fdf"&gt;config
file&lt;/a&gt;,
and proceed to write code, prose, and everything in between.  Would it
be better to (1) stay in Windows, (2) use a word processor to write
prose, and (3) use an IDE to write code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For quickly getting stuff done, I think that choosing these
conventional solutions would typically be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I consider an activity like &lt;em&gt;writing a letter&lt;/em&gt;, I get excited
about booting up Linux, formatting things nicely in LaTeX and playing
around with emacs commands. But TBH, it would be easier to just start
typing in MS Word or Libre office. I can adjust fonts and stuff to
make things look pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about the "One Program Wonder". I think about the "Just make
it werk" user. These people are doing just fine. And I'm taking three
times as along as I need to to finish some task. But you just wait!
The &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; time I have to do something similar, I'll be faster!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...unless I'm messing around with some new software/configuration
again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Chairs suck.</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-07-20:/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I personally dislike using chairs most of the time.

the floor, stand, or walk around to work, reading, thinking,
socializing, etc. Strange? Seething in my dislike for chairs, I
decided to do a little "armchair" research on chairs to find out where
they came from and why they are everywhere in WEIRD ("Western Educated
Industrial Rich Democratic") cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many centuries, chairs were "a symbolic article of state and
  dignity rather than an article for ordinary use" (Wikipedia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The earliest images of chairs in China are from the sixth century,
  but even then sitting in chairs was rare (Wikipedia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing, multi-story buildings, paper money, and examinations all
    have a longer history than chairs in China!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chairs became mainstream in the West and spread especially fast
  during the time of the "Industrial Revolution" (Chair Institute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nowadays, there are a lot of people &lt;a href="https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/"&gt;hating on
  "sitting"&lt;/a&gt;
  (i.e. chairs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty floors vs clean feet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairs are useful if you are wearing shoes, don't plan on taking them
off, and want to sit down. Note that it is nice to sit down on a bench
or chair to remove your footwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairs are not so good if you want to sit on a rug or reach things
that are close to the floor. Removing sandals or slippers requires to
chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Beatles observe George learning Sitar. July 1966." src="https://i.imgur.com/Ci5mHRE.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Source imgur)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hot idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many common clothing items we wear were designed for purposes quite
unlike modern living. For example, long pants came from
horse-riding. Few people these days ride horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I live (California), it is usually rather hot. Rather than
following dressing, eating, and sleeping habits of other hot climate
people, many (most?) Californians like to retreat to air conditioned
coffee shops and dress and act like they live in cooler European
(English/German/French?) places. Why?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good uses of chairs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being required for being socially acceptable in a good many
places, there are a number of situations in which having a chair is
useful. To play the piano, for instance, it makes sense to sit on a
comfortably adjusted piano bench so you can reach the pedals under the
piano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Doge cannot reach pedals" src="https://i.imgur.com/S6vXiNl.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying out some different Linux distributions, and decided to
give the fully-free distro &lt;a href="https://trisquel.info"&gt;Trisquel&lt;/a&gt; a spin.
To my dismay, I found that &lt;a href="http://captainalan.github.io/me"&gt;&lt;em&gt;my own
site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was blocked blocked for some
JavaScript-y reasons. It turns out that all sites that make use of
React (or at least &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt;, the tool I used to bootstrap my
site) are &lt;em&gt;blocked&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/"&gt;certain sorts of
JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; are blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my goal to produce informative, unobtrusive websites that are
easily indexed, linked, downloaded, etc. If I can accomplish this goal
without freedom/privacy threatening software, why not choose simpler
tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am becoming more interested in &lt;strong&gt;static site generators&lt;/strong&gt; (such as
&lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, which was used to make this
site) because the HTML/CSS they spit out is compatible in most places
and they also make things like RSS feeds easy to do. I'll be trying
out various static generators in addition to writing plain HTML/CSS
and maybe some JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry><entry><title>Arch Linux Install for n00bs</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-02T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-06-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-06-02:/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I will go through installing Arch Linux.

time to read through high-quality resources, such as the (official)
Arch Wiki &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide"&gt;installation
guide&lt;/a&gt;.  That
being said, the content in this article should be sufficient to get an
Arch System up and running&amp;em;I've used it multiple times to help me
setup new systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am closely following &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PBqpX0_UOc"&gt;Full Arch Linux Install (SAVAGE Edition!)
Linux&lt;/a&gt; by Luke Smith (March 8,
2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will do a base installation of Arch Linux. Then we'll run &lt;a href="https://lukesmith.xyz"&gt;Luke
Smith's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://larbs.xyz/"&gt;LARBS&lt;/a&gt; script to
get an awesome i3 tiling window manager setup from the outset.  (TODO:
Also -&amp;gt; Add instructions/links to a &lt;strong&gt;NEW&lt;/strong&gt; tutorial about getting a
Desktop Environment, emacs, etc. and choosing a different path).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is aimed at people with some exposure to Linux and/or command
line tools (e.g. using &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; under MacOS), but who would like to gain
greater control of their current computing setups. Here, I honor the maxim
that &lt;em&gt;knowledge is power&lt;/em&gt; and seek to empower you by getting you started
using Arch Linux and understanding the tools that you are using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should know how to do basic things with &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;, or some
other editor readily available in the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Text_terminals"&gt;TTY&lt;/a&gt;,
such as &lt;code&gt;nano&lt;/code&gt;) because doing an Arch install will involve editing
some text files on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation Medium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the latest Arch linux ISO. The easiest thing to do is probably to
download from an HTTP mirror near your (physical) location and then install by CD, DVD, or USB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Windows, creating your installation medium is easy. Right click
on the downloaded &lt;code&gt;.iso&lt;/code&gt; file and select "Burn disc image" to create
CD or DVD to create a your installation medium. Alternatively, you can
use &lt;a href="https://rufus.ie/"&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt; on Windows to create install media on
USB drives, SD cards, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Booting with the installation medium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart your computer. You may have to go into your system BIOS to make sure you can boot from your installation medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get an internet connection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are already connected to the Internet via an ethernet cable, there is
nothing to think about. If you are connecting via Wi-Fi, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;wifi-menu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can't help you anymore if you are connecting from McDonald's wifi... But on
a home network, you will be prompted for your Wi-Fi network's password.
Once you go through the options &lt;code&gt;wifi-menu&lt;/code&gt;, try out your network connection
with something like &lt;code&gt;ping google.com&lt;/code&gt;. Type &lt;code&gt;ctrl-c&lt;/code&gt; to exit when you are
done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Time and date stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;timedatectl set-ntp true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the 'prefix' &lt;em&gt;-ctl&lt;/em&gt; in the command above. Commands with &lt;em&gt;-ctl&lt;/em&gt;
have to do with &lt;em&gt;controlling&lt;/em&gt; system processes. A command we will see
later is
&lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd#Basic_systemctl_usage"&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partitioning your drive(s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let's partition our disks. &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I am assuming you are
installing Arch Linux on a computer you are OK with deleting all data
on. Go reboot and back up your files and stuff if you are not ready to
proceed yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case you can, run &lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;fdisk -l&lt;/code&gt;) to "list all block
devices".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating new partitions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt;, you can identify the drive you want to install Arch Linux on.
This will probably be &lt;code&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/code&gt; if you are installing onto an old computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start changing things.  To begin, type &lt;code&gt;fdisk /dev/sda&lt;/code&gt;, where
'"&lt;code&gt;sda&lt;/code&gt;" corresponds to the &lt;strong&gt;drive&lt;/strong&gt; you wish to create a new
partition table on (don't do &lt;code&gt;fdisk /dev/sda123&lt;/code&gt;; this won't
work&amp;em;go ahead and try that if you don't believe me!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will now be sent to a new prompt that looks something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Command (m for help):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If there are existing partitions you may need to type &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; to delete them.
Type &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; to print partitions. Once you are done deleting existing stuff, type
&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; at the prompt to make a new partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now create the following partitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot partition (200MB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SWAP partition (how much RAM you have, times 1.5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Root (25 GB or more)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home (everything else)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After typing &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, you will be be prompted with a number of options. To create
the Boot partition, accept the first default option (&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;) to create a new
primary partition. Accept &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; as the default partition number. Accept the
default "First sector" location. For the "Last sector", enter &lt;code&gt;+200M&lt;/code&gt;. This means will be the &lt;em&gt;boot&lt;/em&gt; partition which we are allocating 200 MB for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will craete a &lt;strong&gt;swap partition&lt;/strong&gt;. Type &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; again to get started.
Standard practice is to create a swap partition of about 1.5-2 times the
amount of RAM you have. I'll be using 4 GB for this. Accept the default
partion number (probably 2), default first sector, and for the last sector do
&lt;code&gt;+4G&lt;/code&gt; (where you replace "4" with however much memory you select for your
swap partition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now create a &lt;strong&gt;root partition&lt;/strong&gt; where all your programs will be
installed. A reasonable starting size for this is around 25 GB, though you
may need more if you like to install a lot of programs. I'll be using 64 GB.
Typing &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; (and then pressing Enter), I accept the default for the partiton
number and the starting sector and then select &lt;code&gt;+64G&lt;/code&gt; for the last sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to create a &lt;strong&gt;home partition&lt;/strong&gt; which will take up the rest
of your disk. Do &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; for a new partition and then selct &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; (rather than &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;)
to create a new primary partition. Then, accept all the defaults that follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have now created four nice partitions using &lt;code&gt;fdisk&lt;/code&gt;. However, these are
not "commited" to disk yet. Write &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; at the &lt;code&gt;Command (m for help):&lt;/code&gt; prompt
to write your partitions to your disk. Note that this will wipe everything on the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; since we partitioned our disk, you can easily install a different linux distribution if you wanted; just re-write the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; partition and all your &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; files will still be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt; to see how &lt;code&gt;fdisk&lt;/code&gt; changed your harddirve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making filesystems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just partitioned our disks, but we need to set &lt;strong&gt;filesystems&lt;/strong&gt; to our
partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;boot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; partition (&lt;code&gt;sda1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sda3&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sda4&lt;/code&gt; if you
have been following the tutorial for) should be formatted to &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt;, a Linux
standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do &lt;code&gt;mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4&lt;/code&gt; to
set these partitions' filesystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the swap partition do &lt;code&gt;mkswap /dev/sda2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mounting stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have created partitions with appropriate filesystems, we need to
&lt;strong&gt;mount&lt;/strong&gt; things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, do &lt;code&gt;mount /dev/sda3 /mnt&lt;/code&gt; to mount your root partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; at any point during this tutorial you may want to run &lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt; to see
*how your disks currently look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;ls /mnt&lt;/code&gt;. You should see something like &lt;code&gt;lost+found&lt;/code&gt; there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's make make some new directories to mount stuff. First do
&lt;code&gt;mkdir /mnt/boot&lt;/code&gt; create a mount point for our boot partition. Then, run
&lt;code&gt;mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot&lt;/code&gt; to do the actual mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, do &lt;code&gt;mkdir /mnt/home&lt;/code&gt;. Run &lt;code&gt;mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/home&lt;/code&gt; to mount your
home partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing the base system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have all of our partitions and have mounted these partitions on our
file systems. Mounting allows us to modify the data on these partitions,
which means we can install softare (like Arch Linux!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;lsblk&lt;/code&gt; to see that all is as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The fun starts with &lt;code&gt;pacstrap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;pacstrap /mnt base base-devel&lt;/code&gt; to install the base package and basic
development tools. If you want more things, add them like so to this command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 8, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;: You may want to also install &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;linux-firmware&lt;/code&gt; to make sure the latest Linux kernel and appropriate drivers
respectively are installed. Do this &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you install &lt;code&gt;grub&lt;/code&gt; (directions
below) or else you may not be able to boot your new installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacstrap /mnt base base-devel vim emacs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Running this command might take a while because it is installing an entire
base system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making an &lt;code&gt;fstab&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, we mounted a bunch of partitions manually. An &lt;code&gt;fstab&lt;/code&gt; file tells
Linux what to try to load (see &lt;code&gt;etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;). Run &lt;code&gt;genfstab /mnt&lt;/code&gt;. This will
generate an &lt;code&gt;fstab&lt;/code&gt; file based on how &lt;code&gt;mnt&lt;/code&gt; looks. Running this command will
just output a bunch of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to save these things to a file. Run
&lt;code&gt;genfstab -U /mnt &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /mnt/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Arch Linux will know what goes where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making our installation bootable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;arch-chroot /mnt&lt;/code&gt; to change our root. This will change our Arch root to
our new &lt;code&gt;/mnt&lt;/code&gt; directory! Before, we were running from our installation
medium, now we are running from our actual installation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I needs Interwebs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's install some stuff. First, let's install &lt;code&gt;NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt; by typing &lt;code&gt;pacman -S networkmanager&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, type &lt;code&gt;systemctl enable NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt; to start &lt;code&gt;NetworkManager&lt;/code&gt;
whenever you log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GRUB Bootloader&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;pacman -S grub&lt;/code&gt; to install GRUB, our bootloader. This is important!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this finishes, run &lt;code&gt;grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, do &lt;code&gt;grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; to make a config
file. (This might be done automatically.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting a password&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; to set a root password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting a locale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your text editor (here I use &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;) to edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/locale.gen&lt;/code&gt;. I do this
with &lt;code&gt;vim /etc/locale.gen&lt;/code&gt;. In this huge list of locales I uncommented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;#en_US ISO-8859-1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;en_US ISO-8859-1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;...in order to set my locale. Note, you can set multiple languages. Save and
exit this file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, run &lt;code&gt;locale-gen&lt;/code&gt; to read the conf file you just edited and generate a
file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's edit one more file to set our (default) language: &lt;code&gt;vim
/etc/locale.conf&lt;/code&gt;. I changed the contents of this file to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;LANG=en_US.UTF-8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Setting a timezone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, in &lt;code&gt;/etc/localtime&lt;/code&gt;, there are a bunch of time zones. We want to
link &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/zoneinfo/&lt;/code&gt; with our timezone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;...where of course you replace &lt;code&gt;.../America/Los_Angles...&lt;/code&gt; with where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you travel somewhere else, you will rerun the &lt;code&gt;ln...&lt;/code&gt; command here to the
timezone of wherever you are going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting a hostname&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you need to set a name for your computer. Edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/hostname&lt;/code&gt; to
whatever you like. I will do &lt;code&gt;vim /etc/hostname&lt;/code&gt; and enter &lt;code&gt;arch-sama&lt;/code&gt; for a (weeby) hostname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Going back to your installation medium...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; to go back to your installation medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to be safe type &lt;code&gt;umount -R /mnt&lt;/code&gt; to unmount your Arch installation (on
your harddrive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reboot!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;reboot&lt;/code&gt;. Remove your installation medium. You should boot to your new
installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LARBS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the easy part. To get a pretty cool configuration right away, use
Luke Smith's &lt;a href="https://larbs.xyz"&gt;LARBS&lt;/a&gt; setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booting your new Arch setup, login as &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;. You'll be prompted for your
password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -LO larbs.xyz/larbs.sh  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Download the script&lt;/span&gt;
bash larbs.sh                &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Run the script you just downloaded!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Logging in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Login with the username and password you set in LARBS. To modify your system,
you'll probably need to use &lt;code&gt;su&lt;/code&gt; and the password you set for root in the
Arch install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Troubleshooting LARBS install&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you aren't connected to the Internet, this step can be a pain in the ass.
Search the Arch Wiki for wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into issues with &lt;code&gt;xorg&lt;/code&gt;, search for answers related to your graphics
card. Using an older (around 2010) laptop with an NVIDIA graphics card, I had
to install the Nouveau drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Checking your new system out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; came out correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; I found out that my SWAP partition wasn't being used
after following the above steps. Easy way to get SWAP working was to
install gparted (&lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -Syu gparted&lt;/code&gt;) and launch that (&lt;code&gt;sudo
gparted&lt;/code&gt;), then make sure the swap partiton I created had &lt;code&gt;SWAPON&lt;/code&gt;
(find option in menus). You can then &lt;code&gt;sudo swapon --show&lt;/code&gt; to see that
things are working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hard Drive Related Troubleshooting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boot issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I used an "old-school" style of partitioning drives, mounting
partitions, etc.  If you are having trouble booting, you may need to go into
your BIOS to make sure you are booting devices in the correct order. You may
also want to check that your &lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt; directory (mounted to its own partition,
hopefully) is bootable. Look up how to add a boot &lt;strong&gt;flag&lt;/strong&gt; to do this. Two ways
are to use the &lt;code&gt;fdisk&lt;/code&gt; util introduced at the beginning of this tutorial, or do
get an install for another distro (e.g. Ubuntu) and use the graphical tools
(e.g. gparted) to assist you in doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Messed up partitons?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the article "&lt;a href="https://www.tecmint.com/move-home-directory-to-new-partition-disk-in-linux/"&gt;move your home directory to a new partiton&lt;/a&gt;" as a guide. The same approach here can be used for all sorts of directory and partition shuffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic procedure to move your &lt;code&gt;/home/&lt;/code&gt; to a new partition is to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a new partition,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copy your existing &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; directory there and verify this operation succeeded,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remove the old files you just copied,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mount the copied files on the correct (new) partition to &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;save your configuration in &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These operations will require &lt;code&gt;su&lt;/code&gt; permissions (e.g. through using &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Linux"></category></entry><entry><title>HEHEHEHEHE</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/hehehehehe.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-15T10:50:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-05-15T10:50:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-05-15:/pelican-test/hehehehehe.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is a pleasure to edit in Markdown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After half a year or so of learning all about dynamic websites (using
fancy new technology like Node.js), I've found myself returning to
good old-fashioned static sites for my personal projects. Here I'll go
through some reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Updated 8/12/2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After half a year or so of learning all about dynamic websites (using
fancy new technology like Node.js), I've found myself returning to
good old-fashioned static sites for my personal projects. Here I'll go
through some reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two approaches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider two scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write a program that produces content for that user when a
   user runs it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You write a program that produces content; you then distribute that
   content to people that want it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first approach here is how a lot of &lt;em&gt;dynamic&lt;/em&gt; websites work. You
write &lt;strong&gt;server side code&lt;/strong&gt; in something like JavaScript (Node), PHP,
Python, etc. to produce webpages on the fly for users. To do this,
you may have to go through lots of trials and tribulations to get your
program ('website') up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second approach is how &lt;em&gt;static sites&lt;/em&gt; work. The "programming"
involved (if any) is to generate content once. Compare this to
&lt;em&gt;compiling&lt;/em&gt; a high(er) level programming language into machine
code. Once you produce useful output, it is easy to distribute it
(there are many places, including GitHub pages, that can serve
&lt;strong&gt;static assets&lt;/strong&gt; for free).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dynamic websites, you might worry about hackers sending malicious
inputs into your website and blowing stuff up. With static websites,
this is not an issue. If you were really worried about one server
where your content is hosted, you could easily create &lt;strong&gt;mirror(s)&lt;/strong&gt; of
your content. Static sites deploy easily, without special
considerations about what will compile, what will be allowed,
etc. Everything is packaged up nicely and good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know your needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, static sites will do. Don't be pulled in by the buzz
words and hype of fancy platforms if all you need is some hosting for
HTML/CSS files and some images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simplifying web development means having more time available to focus
on producing quality content, rather than wrestling with abstractions
and engineering-ish problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you should write a math or engineering blog if you wanna do
either of those activities, respectively 😡&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Interwebs"></category></entry></feed>
