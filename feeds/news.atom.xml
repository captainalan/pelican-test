times. Take a morning commute, for instance. Sitting in traffic on the
way to sit in a cubicle?! Now I repent; I find myself missing lots of
these things now that I'm staying in most every day, most all the
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this COVID-19 business has made me appreciate how having certain
discrete "events" in my day&amp;mdash;which at times may have seemed
annoying&amp;mdash;have acted as useful for anchor points for both
structuring my time and "keeping up" with various things I don't
typically directly concern myself with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, through riding my bicycle to class/study, I gained lots
of first-hand knowledge of on-going (societal) trends. I don't really
feel much of an intrinsic desire to keep up with pop culture. But,
going around town, I'd hear songs, see people with graphic T-shirts,
etc., which would inform me about what's buzzing. I'd see what kinds
of pets were popular, how Chinese vs Japanese vs Korean fashions
differed, what restaurants were popular... All sorts of observations
that contributed to understanding "what it is like" &lt;em&gt;to be&lt;/em&gt; in
such-and-such time and place happened during the "transition times" of
commuting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being in the &lt;em&gt;same world&lt;/em&gt; as others, we learn to relate with one
another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"The Routine" as Shared Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility of activities such as the morning commute do not become
apparent until they are gone. Lock-down times have taught me how
important many aspects of routine are in developing a sense of
connection with the people around me. We need &lt;em&gt;shared context&lt;/em&gt; with
those around us to understand each other; simple routine things like
&lt;em&gt;having to go to meetings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;commuting along XYZ freeway&lt;/em&gt; are
representative "lowest common denominator" ways in which we can relate
to one another &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through all this lock down stuff makes me reflect on &lt;em&gt;how very
different&lt;/em&gt; each of us is experiencing COVID-19. Aside from the
Internet, we lack a "common space" to meet one another&amp;mdash;in the
past decade or so of my life, this has been school/coffee
shops/restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Re-creating Shared Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these physically isolated times, it is in the shared spaces of
social media (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, games,
Discord, etc.)  that we establish norms and shared experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider it important that we have &lt;em&gt;individuals&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;not just
polished corporate accounts&amp;mdash;producing content. Meme
"shit-posting", status update ramblings, and rando-comments are all
things we can do to claim our place in "writing the narrative" of what
COVID-19 was like. Nobody is going to passively observe me walking
around town, because I'm parking my butt according to lock-down
directives. But somebody might scroll by a click-bait title I produce,
and in this sense, I enter the subconscious in the same way I would
walking down a street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only for the time being, the streets that we "walk" down are social
media feeds of various sorts. Until we can again freely walk the
streets, we stroll down the "public" boulevards of the Interwebs via
social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Lowest Common Denominator" means that it doesn't require
special knowledge, training, subtlety etc. to understand these
things. Generally accessible. Like Marvel movies or Boba tea.
Contrast with "acquired tastes" (such as differentiating varieties
of black coffee or kimchi; expertise on 19th century Russian
novels)&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

locked-down times end &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We are seeing some major signs of turning
tides with respect to policy. As for the science/biology about what is
actually going on with COVID-19, I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As summer arrives in sunny California, we are seeing longer
days. Soon, people around the Northern hemisphere will be flipping on
their air conditioning units &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Maybe as the weather heats up,
people will become content with staying in (so long as finances are
taken care of)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some how, in some way, people are hanging on. Many have accepted
locked-in life as the "new normal". Others wait in anticipation for
&lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; to change and then automatically exploit any loopholes they
can to still be "well behaved" citizens &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hope of Risk Free Returns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few months, we've seen &lt;em&gt;a preference for security and
risk-free returns&lt;/em&gt;. That is, people would rather have a lock down and
keep things more "safe" rather than facing the dangerous unknown.
We're seeing a shift away from this as lock-down policies are wearing
people down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Guaranteed "Side Effects" to Avoid Possible "Main Effects"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I see happening is a general shift towards reacting to &lt;strong&gt;known
side-effects&lt;/strong&gt; (economic problems), away from responding to &lt;strong&gt;unknown
main effects&lt;/strong&gt; (the actual dangers of COVID-19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping work for a week or two is something &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; working people can
do, especially if they are still getting paid and/or can work
remotely. However, as companies have begun laying off more and more
employees (especially small businesses, who don't make enough money to
'weather the storm'), we are seeing more agitation to end lock-down
policies and "open up" society again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are feeling the real costs of lock-down. If you do things like
fasting and make doing nothing a sport (meditating), you are probably
OK during lock down. For those that don't have some kind of
"minimalism" as a hobby, times are tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to get everyone to shut up, behave, and honor essential
workers as heroes are getting tiresome as people find themselves
regulated into powerlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding Your Own Risk Free Returns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own strategy approaching the challenges of lock-in is to look for
places where my own effort input has an effect. There are many realms
where there are basically risk-free returns, e.g. doing
pushups. Assuming you don't totally overdo it, the more pushups you
do, the more fit you will become &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having projects like (1) completing reading books, (2) working through
problems/exercises, (3) establishing regular contact with
friends/family members, (4) maintaining a garden, and (5) acquiring
proficiency in a foreign language, require continued application of
concentrated efforts. The remedy for feeling like you are doing
nothing is to &lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I know I will see is that once all this lock-down business is
over, I will emerge as a better person in many ways because I have
dedicated myself to some projects during these trying times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Warrior in Waiting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many jobs where making good use of time while &lt;em&gt;waiting&lt;/em&gt; is
what is most important. Firefighters and &lt;em&gt;samurai&lt;/em&gt; both do not
spend most of their time putting out fires and slicing up enemies,
respectively. Rather, most of their time is spent preparing and
training so when critical encounters do happen, they are well-poised
to respond with utmost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is our turn to live the &lt;em&gt;way of the warrior&lt;/em&gt; and use our time to
prepare. When lock down policies sufficiently loosen up, it will be
our turn again to apply for jobs, climb mountains, go on dates,
etc. Until then, we train like a hardworking &lt;em&gt;choo-choo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw recommendations for "online therapy" from viewing YouTube
in a logged out, relatively private browser so I'm assuming these
are general rather than targeted ads.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I have learned &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to flip on the AC from watching
&lt;em&gt;One Punch Man&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;uwu&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the &lt;em&gt;reasons behind why rules are made&lt;/em&gt;, not the fine
language used in them u bozos. Jesus taught Christians to look at
&lt;em&gt;the spirit&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;the letter&lt;/em&gt; of the law.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same cannot be said for practicing extreme sports, where
chances of injury may outweigh physical benefits.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Choo-choo train" go huff puff&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;analyze stuff to see why I was wrong and hopefully learn something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, I do a write-up here because it is more interesting
than being wish-washy and saying "it's complicated" without making any
concrete predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No "Universal Vaccination"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that we'll see a widely accepted vaccine being developed
in the next month or two. By the time something is developed, I think
that the main "scare" of COVID-19 will be past.  Already, we see many
places starting to open up &lt;em&gt;despite there being no vaccine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sub-claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things will continue opening up, regardless if there is a vaccine or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a vaccine is developed, stuff will likely already be sufficiently
  opened up that people will opt out of taking it unless forced to
  (e.g. by their employer, government mandate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, I think more people will start getting flu shots and stuff
  after COVID-19, but institutional skepticism on a whole will
  likewise grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forced vaccination will be met with resistance from vocal
  minorities; in practice I think you can't force everyone to have a
  vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remote Work Will Grow, But Not Dramatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people got to "experiment" with remote work. Most people I have
talked with that have kept their jobs &lt;em&gt;don't like remote work&lt;/em&gt;. With
certain exceptions (e.g. computer programers), I think that
by-in-large, people will want to continue working in offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerds often think that other people have "rational" motivation
structures like them. They fail to see that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many (most?) people are strongly driven by external motivation,
  which can be negative (fear of punishment) or positive (praise,
  raises, etc.); traditional workplaces make it easier to deliver
  these incentives than remote work which puts a lot of
  technology-fiddling overhead on most involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people at some point declare "technological bankruptcy"; they
  simply decide they don't/can't use XYZ technology and stop learning
  more; learning new tech all the time is something nerds gravitate
  towards, but most people hate doing this and will resist change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote work &lt;em&gt;is costly&lt;/em&gt;; while paying rent for an office is
  expensive, wasting time dealing with people's failing microphones,
  noisy backgrounds, accidental screenshares, etc. wastes a lot of
  time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many jobs filled with people already well-prepared for remote work
will likely continue exploring/expanding remote operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think there will be a general trend for non-nerd work to
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; become more remote; many people have tried remote work and
decided &lt;em&gt;they don't like it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Establishment Will Survive (and Thrive)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many small businesses might get hit very hard, but the big players are
likely to sale through all of this stuff OK. Many tech stocks are
likely to do quite well, e.g. Amazon. I think that banks and oil will
also end up OK because of how tied up in government things they are;
the establishment is continuing the "too big to fail" thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that banks, companies, etc. will have rather lenient policies
for repaying loans and stuff &lt;em&gt;for the time being&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;meaning, we're not
going to see thugs from credit card companies knocking on people's
doors demanding money any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like college debt, I think that repayment stuff &lt;em&gt;will be
remembered&lt;/em&gt; by the establishment and there will be nothing like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_(biblical)"&gt;The
Jubilee&lt;/a&gt; given
to those hard hit by COVID-19, just temporary "good enough" relief to
prevent angry mobs with pitchforks and fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 stuff slowly wraps up, I think that people will emerge
with dramatically different conclusions. Many prepper/right-wing types
will emerge feeling vindicated for taking things into their own hands
and preparing supplies and stuff before all this virus business.
They&amp;mdash;along with many religious people&amp;mdash;will (correctly) see
that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Times of chaos can and will be used by governments to extend usual
  authority and implement new "temporary" policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Temporary" measures put in place during times of emergency may be
  used for all sorts of tricky stuff later (see 9-11, PATRIOT Act, and
  the expansion of the surveillance state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many on the political left would like a more "maternal" state caring
  for (and controlling) the population in various ways, e.g. pushing
  solutions for how the nation &lt;em&gt;as a whole&lt;/em&gt; should evaluate and
  respond to risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, more left-leaning types will emerge feeling
vindicated by (correctly) seeing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their nations are ununified; struggles between different groups and
  partisan media that focuses on &lt;em&gt;differences&lt;/em&gt; rather than on how
  people are similar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many rejecting mainstream science (acting like "idiots" in their
  view); we will see many examples of more right-wing type people
  dying and stuff because they didn't listen to the establishment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A more urgent demand/need for healthcare reform (or &lt;em&gt;¡revolución!&lt;/em&gt;)
  in the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How capitalism as a sole operating principle doesn't solve
  everything (think: critique of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3164890827?book_show_action=false&amp;amp;from_review_page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atlas
  Shrugged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  by Ayn Rand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't expect to see much jumping from one side or the other of the
political spectrum. Left-leaning people will dig deeper into the need
for institutional solutions while more libertarian x right-leaning
people will want the establishment to
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BTFO"&gt;BTFO&lt;/a&gt;.  Both
the left and right broadly (no, you &lt;em&gt;NUANCE BROS&lt;/em&gt;, I'm not going to
"resist the dichotomy") will be able to find validation for their
worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, all in all, I think the right-wingers will come out feeling a
lot better than the left-wingers overall. This is because the
left-wingers want institutional solutions to what they perceive as
problems, and COVID-19 (metaphorically) kicked the establishment in
the balls. The establishment is rolling around in pain a little bit
now &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Bernie Sanders is not the Dem party blessed
choice. Meanwhile, right wingers with their values in self-sufficiency
and building up families and communities (rather than exploring the
arts) instead of state power (okay, now I'm talking more about
&lt;strong&gt;libertarian&lt;/strong&gt; leaning right-wing types, not war-hawk hegemonic
theocratic types) will emerge from all of this feeling like had been
on the right track before all of this with their trucks, guns, and
gallons of water.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 5</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-5.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-04-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-04-24:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-5.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will describe how the delivery of information and

communication have changed during my life thus far, highlighting ways
in which current "high tech" ways of doing things have empowered small
groups of (technocratic) elites and the parties that pressure them to
push their (socio-political) agendas while undermining the well-being
of people who just want to build communities with their families
and friends while having some fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The evolution of information delivery pipelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a millennial (born in 1992), I recall a time when Internet access
was limited; it was a new and exciting "high tech" thing and having
access to computers was a kind of status symbol. Zoomers&amp;mdash;born
and raised surrounded by Internet connected technologies&amp;mdash;did not
experience the transaction from the "pre-Internet" world to the
"Digital Age" just as most millennials don't have the experiences that
lead many Boomers to become globalism embracing hippies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that overall, the expansion of the Internet (c.f. THE MATRIX)
has led to a much more &lt;strong&gt;fragile&lt;/strong&gt; world in the sense any one group's
decisions can have
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEA33bAXyNM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hyuuuuuuuuuuuuuge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
consequences. Effectively, this means that propaganda is more
effective and faster acting. Like a machine gun versus a hunting
rifle. Frightening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The reach of news&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 20th century, people often got news through the "legacy media"
in forms like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newspapers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magazines (e.g. Time magazine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broadcast media (television, radio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These forms of "legacy media" are non-interactive in the sense that
they don't have something like &lt;em&gt;comments&lt;/em&gt; sections that give instant
feedback. You could call into a talk show or something, but
participating in things like this is not the default behavior of most
listeners&amp;mdash;most people
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lurk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lurk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
actively observe but not contribute content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, there was news everywhere even before my time&amp;mdash;for
instance in the 1980s, I imagine there were lots of TV broadcasts
running in corporate break rooms, dentists' offices certainly had lots
of magazines, super markets put tabloids near the front of the
store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, news media was not as &lt;em&gt;pushy&lt;/em&gt; as it is now on the
Internet. You could simply avert your gaze and look at something else;
nowadays, getting rid of news, advertisements, etc. often takes some
technical know-how and complex configuration&amp;mdash;it is not something
that can done instinctually with no training. The channels of
information in which news is delivered are required for daily (urban)
living: students must use web browsers to interact with their schools
and complete assignments, many companies are moving towards
electronic-only "paperwork", etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerd aside&lt;/strong&gt;: This trend has invaded even privacy + free information
concerned spaces.  A recent-ish annoying thing is that the Firefox web
browser pushed news stories onto their default home
page&amp;mdash;alienating nerds who had chosen firefox to avoid things
like this that happen on browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social interactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News sitting in web browsers is non-threatening enough. But what about
wearing an advertisement on your forehead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much of what is being normalized in what I will call
&lt;strong&gt;corporate mediated communication&lt;/strong&gt;, using communications technology
(such as messenging apps) where corporate interests are pushed on the
user. This is perhaps the biggest problem I am seeing with information
technology today. One-on-one communication reaks of third party
intervention!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some context&amp;mdash;besides face to face conversations, the
pre-Internet channels for communication include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone calls (LAN line means ur mom could be eavesdropping)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letters/postcards (relatively long form; you have to pay money to send)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other solutions, e.g. leaving notes on the refrigerator, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these media feel particularly "corporate". Sure, you probably
have to work with a company to get your phone line set up, but then
after that, you are largely left alone&amp;mdash;we'll assume nobody is
tapping your wire for now, ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so with smartphones/apps and most (desktop) online experiences!  I
leave Candy Crush installed in Windows 10 so that when I open the
Start menu, I can be reminded that I am in THE MATRIX. When you open
your (smart)phone, unless you flipped a bunch of options, you are
probably greeted by all sorts of news. Android pushes a lot of Google
news and stuff at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these things, if only for an instant, &lt;em&gt;colors our
conversations&lt;/em&gt;. Google/Apple/etc. seizes a bit of our attention before
we started chatting with our friends/family, listening to music, etc.
We may &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we aren't paying attention to these things, but the
headlines and stuff stick&amp;mdash;we get the sense that "the whole world
is doing XYZ"... ...big corporations are determining the contexts of
our conversations by setting mood lighting to their robo-desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Locked Down, Locked In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people are having fewer face-to-face conversations (because they
are not going out), more and more acts of communication
("conversations") are being carried out through corporate-mediated
communications technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevailing narratives such as "END OF WORLD", "TRUMP BAD", "CHINESE
VIRUS", etc. infect people's thinking as tech companies troll our
minds by constantly telling us &lt;em&gt;what to think about&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you open a tool box, your hammer may suggest hitting nails to you,
but that is about it. A piano sitting in your living room may suggest
"you should practice", but it doesn't say "think about XYZ; should we
do military intervention?!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made some conscious decisions about how I set up my tech, I am
relatively well off standing back and analyzing what's going on with
the news and stuff. But I don't expect this of most
people&amp;mdash;especially if they are busy doing important work like
saving people as medical workers or keeping our (already crumbling)
infrastructure from totally collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current attitude is to low-key hate smartphones specifically, but a
lot of the "information ecosystem" more broadly, and avoid invasive
technologies most of the time. Nonetheless, I recognize that these
technologies are ubiquitous things and that I can't get away with not
using one (at least until I have a family of my own, some land,
etc). I was born and raised in THE MATRIX and I must do my part to
help those still in it. So I am doing things like this... writing blog
posts to share my thoughts to hopefully help at least some people see
what is going on with information delivery and then make better
informed decisions about things rather than accept the terrible
"default settings" which we are naively handed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 4</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-4.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-24:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-4.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What do I do under quarantine lock-down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Oscillating between different activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try something for a while, for instance solving some problem or
reading a chapter of a book. Sooner or later, it will become too
boring/difficult to continue. So, I'll switch to another activity that
I think I should be doing. Repeatedly cycling through different
activities I should be doing, I end up "clocking in" lots of time
doing productive stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workout (e.g. pushup sets, crunches)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign language study (e.g. read some news in Chinese, review some
  Spanish grammar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuss with some Linux config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse over the documentation for some programing language (mostly
  Node, Golang, bash these days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to solve some fussy CSS problem &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing blog posts (like this one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing some &lt;em&gt;Étude&lt;/em&gt; on some musical instrument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the individual activities above often is not the most fun
thing in the world to do. But the variety of being able to cycle
through them means lots of little sessions of intense focus. I lower
my expectations for myself by only expecting to concentrate for like
20 minutes at a time. Workout bursts are even shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sundown I'm usually adequately tired (or interested in something)
that I don't need to ask myself about what to do next. If I feel like
sleeping at 9 PM, sure, I'll go to sleep. If I wanna stay up reading
about how Arab Nationalism didn't work, sure I'll go do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcomed Interruptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punctuating the above routine with sending/receiving a message or two,
looking at the whatever noise I heard outside, flipping through some
book, etc. keeps me feeling "in the loop".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something something &lt;em&gt;flow like water&lt;/em&gt; uhh... zen... yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, it didn't taste excellent, but that's how stuff goes. Every
meal every time doesn't need to be excellent; sometimes we just have
better/worse ingredients available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cooking experience reminds me of something I am trying to do in
other domains of life. That is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Don't be a hipster"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;똑바로 해&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting comfortable with standard tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, there have been different &lt;em&gt;schools&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;styles&lt;/em&gt; of
cooking. Different regions of planet earth had different ingredients
available, different cultural taboos, etc. And so cuisines developed
around core ingredients and time-tested methods to make those
ingredients taste good, kill disease, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking is very daunting if you are always jumping around trying to
make this-and-that culture's ingredients. You may even find yourself
buying specialized tools for all sorts of specific tasks (e.g. a torch
thing for &lt;em&gt;Crème brûlée&lt;/em&gt;, a fancy wok for some South Chinese style
stir-fry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, it pays to learn some standard tools well in other
domains. Jumping around and chasing diversity ("spreading yourself too
thin") is &lt;em&gt;no bueno&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer&lt;/strong&gt;: lots of unix things; computer science fundamentals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;: Look at common, well-regarded music. Don't get lost in
  equipment. Focus on core skills...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Languages&lt;/strong&gt;: standard usage; common colloquial stuff (don't go down
  rabbit hole of dialects and stuff unless you have a specific social
  reason to do so)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the "vanilla" defaults well gives you more freedom because you
can only make variations of the "default" when you &lt;em&gt;first know the
default&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literary Aside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What good are novels/movies/etc. flipping over narratives left and
right when the main audience no longer knows the default narrative?
The overly flipped narratives become the default narrative. And
suddenly the old dusty book has the edgy take.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 2</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-22:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reporting again from self-quarantine, your independent media 👋 Today

&lt;p&gt;First things first …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reporting again from self-quarantine, your independent media 👋 Today
we are going to do some more armchair sociology and
psychologizing. Buckle up ("Click it or Ticket") and grab your
favorite face cover, things are about to get sneezy. Might even add
some abstractions and philosophy to the mix...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, let's define a term: &lt;strong&gt;belief&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regarding "Belief"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English, we have this word "believe" which is quite peculiar. It
has &lt;em&gt;strong religious connotations&lt;/em&gt;. Many would say the question of
whether or not someone is a Christian ultimately comes down to a
question of &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;. But what exactly does it mean to "believe"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to look at "belief" is to see it as a &lt;em&gt;publicly alignment&lt;/em&gt; to
some cause. That is, one goes out in public and makes some
assertion. They are bound to their word.  This way of looking at
belief makes a lot of sense because it has to deal with contracts and
stuff, which America has a lot of maybe mostly owing to British
origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at "belief" is to evaluate &lt;em&gt;what people do&lt;/em&gt; rather
than &lt;em&gt;what people say&lt;/em&gt;. Truly, if you believed your house was fire,
you would do something about it, wouldn't you? By this definition of
belief, we have to prove that we believe something by how we act. From
certain stated axioms, do your actions (rationally) follow? If not,
our actions reveal what we
&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually"&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now given two senses of the word "belief", I will proceed to
characterize the crises of belief currently befalling many of the
people of planet earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State of Disbelief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of the senses of the word "belief" above, we see that we are
collectively in a &lt;strong&gt;state of disbelief&lt;/strong&gt;. You probably can see the pun
I am making with the word "state" too 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we see people making all sorts of assertions about
the state of the world, what's going on. Then we look at what people
are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person might be able to perfectly recite some &lt;strong&gt;ideology&lt;/strong&gt;, giving
the "right answers" by basic logic + mental algebra. But when that
ideology doesn't line up with reality, we see what that person really
&lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; in the second sense I gave above&amp;mdash;their actions
manifest where their real convictions lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such behavior is sometimes can be called "hypocrisy", but I often see
it as more of a struggle to reconcile a collapsing world view. Maybe
"managing cognitive dissonance" or something like that for many
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Theory Shmeary!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everyone and their favorite non-profit is trying to push some
ideology, it is not surprising that people often hold many incoherent
"beliefs" when taken together as declarations of belief. One might at
one time utter the words,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open borders! No kids in cages!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed borders! Keep everyone safe, Drumpf is an overconfident idiot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free market! We need everyone to have goods/services no matter the cost!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government rationing of supplies! Planned economy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and this is because these statements are taken from disjoint
self-contained systems (though not necessarily so). One person can say
them all; we are not computers that blow up if there is some "logical
contradiction".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My analysis is that these things people say belong to the first sense
of &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;publically making known one's adherence to some
words. One might analyze this as a sort of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act"&gt;speect
act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Globalists x NeoLiberals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One class of people I see getting hit hard are the relatively
&lt;strong&gt;xenophilic&lt;/strong&gt; ("foreign-stuff loving") types. These folks often like
to celebrate how people/places/cultures that are not them are
great. Imagine learning some foreign language of a people/culture you
do not belong to (oh no, I see my reflection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see many of these folks turning inward, displaying their true
colors. It is not about diversity and decentralization of power
(e.g. competing US, European Union, Chinese, Russian, Pan-Indic,
Islamic forces vying for power...), it is about issuing in a
"democratic world order" in which the world is a zoo of cultures to
visit with a German (not to be confused with &lt;em&gt;Nazi&lt;/em&gt;, mind you)
passport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they announce is that they embrace diversity, respect other
cultures, etc. What their actions show they &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; is that they
have all the right answers and that these things should be exported at
the point of a gun to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the astute can see through the ideological &lt;strong&gt;virtue
signalling&lt;/strong&gt; of people saying how tolerant, diversity embracing, blah
blah they are. Such behavior made sense to climb up corporate ladders
and stuff in the pre-COVID-19 world. But when institutions shut down
and do not intervene between reality, shit hits the fan with &lt;em&gt;no
intervening toilet paper&lt;/em&gt;. The horror!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Traditionalists vs Revolutionaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people really like ritual, and just do stuff just because. I'll
call them &lt;strong&gt;traditionalists&lt;/strong&gt;. They may tell you that they don't need
a reason for doing what they are doing, they just do.  Insofar as
these people are able to keep up their traditions, they seem pretty
chill through all this quarantine business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditionalist doesn't need to explain at every step. They act in
a way that has led to survival in the past. The traditionalist
&lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; tradition will allow them to weather this storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let is call the opposite of traditionalist a
&lt;strong&gt;revolutionary&lt;/strong&gt;. Revolutionaries want to overturn tradition and
forge a new path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, being a "revolutionary" in a left-wingy sense has become
quite... mainstream. So we see lots of self-proclaimed left wingers
doing things like voting for Joe Biden. Voting to &lt;em&gt;conserve the
establishment&lt;/em&gt;. Lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the idea of the "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority"&gt;silent
majority&lt;/a&gt;" makes sense
to me. We see people who make the gestures of "revolutionaries" at
times, campaigning for social justice and all. But in the end, they
are establishment mongers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's OK in my book; you don't choose everything about who you are,
including dispositions towards certain behvaiors. I hope your
"revolutionary" comrades do treat you alright though if you fall into
this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So... what's your point?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we see many mismatches between word and deed all around us
everyday. In a time of crisis, like with impending
&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/corona-chan"&gt;Corona&lt;em&gt;-chan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is
evermore easy to see the "raw belief" of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not condemn widespread hypocrisy around me. Rather I observe a
struggle to resolve ideologies&amp;mdash;often fragmented and incomplete,
consisting of collected sayings (c.f. Confucian &lt;em&gt;Analects&lt;/em&gt;). People
are being tested for what they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe in the sense that
they are being forced into action. Certain actions reveal a mismatch
between proclaimed ideology and assessment of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think it is important to not get too fixated on witch
hunting based on proclaimed ideology because many people around the
world just proclaim what they do to stay alive. Much of China says
"yes communism!" because they didn't want to die; now they are acting
in a very much "yes fascism!" way in the sense that we see a marriage
of government and industry... PUNCH ALL CHINESE BECAUSE THEY ARE
FACISTS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bruh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other languages aside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other languages have lots of words (and even grammatical structure) to
discuss all things &lt;strong&gt;epistemological&lt;/strong&gt; (having to do with what
&lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; and what is &lt;em&gt;knowable&lt;/em&gt;, see
&lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/"&gt;SPE&lt;/a&gt; for more
info).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish has a word &lt;em&gt;confiar&lt;/em&gt; which might sometimes be used in contexts
similar to "believe". But this word is also often translated as things
like "trust" (as in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; in the process&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The East Asian languages have translations from missionaries of words
in the Bible dealing with belief. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 1</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-20:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In contemporary times, Japanese people are famous being good at

heard that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/5huKA_11/status/1237687423687155713"&gt;Japan was running out of toilet
paper&lt;/a&gt; and
that there were issues with people hoarding and buying out stores, I
knew that there was going to be trouble. Although my inner-prepper had
already led me to prep with things like things canned foods,
fire-starting devices, and knives (for cooking and chopping up
plants), it became clear to me that preparing more couldn't hurt. So
while stuff was still in stock, I went out and bought some more
essentials. At this point in the virus explosion timeline, everything
in the US was running as usual. COVID-19 (then sometimes called "Wuhan
Virus") &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; in the mainstream news, but businesses were still open
and running as usual. I think the stock market took some little dips,
but nothing major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom ahead a few weeks, and we see major market crashing action, Joe
Biden leading the Democrats, and some areas of the world (e.g. Italy)
hit very hard. Optimists say to expect maybe three more weeks of this,
but the inner &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doomer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doomer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
within each of us knows to expect more chaos for longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not too long ago finished filing taxes, so I didn't go sell off
all my stocks. I didn't wanna think about markets, government
intervention, and everything in between. Then the Federal Reserve
money printers started whirring. &lt;em&gt;brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Invisible Enemies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the news through all of this has been a bullshit filtering
exercise of great proportion. The scientifically minded are a bit more
comfortable with just &lt;em&gt;how little we know&lt;/em&gt;, but this is not the case
for the public at large. People turn every which way for
&lt;em&gt;authority&lt;/em&gt;. Some turn to popular personalities, others to
governments, and yet others to corporate e-mail announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one common thread that I see running through all these
reactions.  In the words of President Donald Trump, we're fighting an
&lt;strong&gt;"invisible enemy"&lt;/strong&gt;. Each person has constructed a different "invisible
enemy", though none can deny the chaos befalling our dear globalist
order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Containment Measures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you like... can't see a virus with the naked eye. So in a
very literal sense, we are fighting an "invisible enemy" since we
can't see viruses. I hope you are doing your part to not be part of
the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "invisible enemy" does not immediately manifest itself. Even
breathing the same air as a healthy looking person can potentially
mean infection. The orders to practice &lt;strong&gt;"social distancing"&lt;/strong&gt; thus
urge people to not just avoid overtly coughting and weezing humans
around them, but to generally avoid breathing the same air as others
since we &lt;em&gt;don't know who may be infected&lt;/em&gt;. This is how we try to
contain the spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mostly-remote web developer, practicing "social distancing"
hasn't been much of a change for me in terms of day-to-day
lifestyle. However, as businesses continue closing their doors and
governments have begun issuing "shelter in place" orders, even my
already rather isolated remote life is being affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not yet know anyone personally who is infected with the virus,
though I expect I probably will in the near future. I plan to consider
taking quarantine stuff seriously. In terms of &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; goals (as
opposed to &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; goals like avoiding sickness and death) I intend
to do more pushups, squats, and crunches on the dungeon floor as well
as skipping rope in the corner of my yard. Current hobbies continue to
be studying foreign languages, doing computer nerd stuff, and
occasionally trying to make pleasant sounds on musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing for young-ish healthy people to do, I think, is to
&lt;em&gt;respect the enemy (virus)&lt;/em&gt; and to not "YOLO, whatever I'm traveling
to Italy!". This is mainly out of concern for others, though it may
very likely be a life-saving alignment for oneself. Those who have the
power to not end up in the hospital should choose to not end up in the
hospital so that those that need help can get it. Plus, it is no fun
to go to the hospital, but I didn't have to tell you that probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fanning the flames of ethnic tensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mainstream media's response to COVID-19 has also done much to fan
the flames of existing tensions. I see my ethnic demographic
(&lt;strong&gt;Asian-Americans&lt;/strong&gt;) getting worked up against (white) people who do
not xenophilically embrace them. Certainly, hostilities exist between
different people groups. Just listen to a second-generation
Chinese-American immigrant mother describe how dirty white people are
for leaving their shoes on in homes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet we (Asian-Americans) are programmed to see micro-aggression in any
vanilla colored smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As COVID-19 rages, we see individuals &lt;em&gt;returning to ethnic enclaves&lt;/em&gt;
(oftentimes families where near everyone is of the same ethnicity). I
don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. But it is worth pointing
out that in times of trial people tend to reveal where their loyalties
really lie. Narratives of persecution &lt;em&gt;have not helped Americans
towards further solidarity with one another&lt;/em&gt;. Rather, they have
encouraged people to dig deeper into their
Semitic/Chinese/Indian/etc. tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also see people withdrawing into philosophical/intellectual (rather
than ethnic) camps. Groups of people united by something like a common
profession (e.g. programers) or a shared ideology (e.g. "secular
humanists") band may be able to survive together, at least for one
generation. However I believe that in the long run, ethnic and/or
religious affiliations are a more robust strategy, because
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neckbeard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;neckbeards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
cannot give birth to new generations with other neckbeards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Religion Rising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing institutional incomeptence, religion is looking healthier
overall from what I can see. People want to see other people and
communities. They would rather pray to God than see what demonic
bargains the governments of the world have to offer them next. The
promise of liberalism and globalism seems less appealing, even if the
Kingdom of Heaven cannot be known except through faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online social lyfe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these tough times, we must recognize our nature as a "social
species" (though I think individuals differ drastically on how much
social contact they want).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm around if you contact me on FB, LINE, Kakao, or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more "public" like experience, I've been very impressed with
Discord. Come hang out with me and others on the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/2RFwR7R"&gt;Xah Lee
Discord&lt;/a&gt; server to meet interesting people
from all over the world and talk about anything under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes to self&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole boatload (non-infected, I hope) of topics to discuss
relating to all this coronavirus stuff. Here I list some things I want
to discuss further in the future. Feel free to reach out and suggest
ideas if you would like to see a discussion on anything...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antifragile&lt;/em&gt; (N.N. Taleb) and why none of the "collapse" we are
  witnessing is surprising at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese media vs Western media on current events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Internet and signal vs noise; bullshit filtering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;about Internet communications, generally &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my experience with remote work&lt;/li&gt;

I was not
necessarily opposed to Yang, but was by no means an ardent supporter

messages/campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First are some impressions/observations:&lt;/p&gt;

necessarily opposed to Yang, but was by no means an ardent supporter
either. Here's I share some thoughts about Yang's political
messages/campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First are some impressions/observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yang campaigned hard on &lt;strong&gt;Universal Basic Income&lt;/strong&gt;, $1000 bucks a
  month for pretty much all adults in a certain age range&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I accept Yang's point that this is probably a better
  redistribution scheme than other existing programs, layers and
  layers of bureaucracy, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would not like to see the government expand; it is unclear to
  me if Yang's Freedom Divident (aka &lt;strong&gt;NEET bux&lt;/strong&gt;) would be
  accompanied by cutting government spending elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If UBI were to come to be, I'd expect a proliferation of
  subsisting people living ant-style (&lt;em&gt;ari-zoku&lt;/em&gt;) for free; talk
  about danger for epidemics! A specialized class of rent-farmers
  would likely thrive too... (speculation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yang's race/ethnicity is a whatever to me&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But I see you racialists out there choosing Yang just because
  he's "of color" or "Asian" just like people chose Obama for
  similar reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think that there are both people more inclined to vote for
  Yang &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; he's Asian, and also people who would choose not
  to because of that... ...or maybe it's more about him appealing
  to the "nerd" demographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk of the threat of Artificial Intelligence and climate change
  without talk about populations/demographics gets the noggin' joggin'&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should governments decide which groups to subsidize (and
  hence increase) at the expense of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Insert Leftist critiques of big oil, tobacco industries, and
  related topics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yang appears to me to be a pretty good guy, and a sincere person. In
this way, I think he has a trustworthy "feel" like Sanders. However, I
do believe his policies in general would drive America to be worse and
worse; sorry Ayn Rand brainwashed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dichotomous Political Opinions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;, I like how Yang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criticizes the inefficiency of government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has a scheme to allow capitalism, but with some safety net&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see how people relate UBI to "classical liberal" thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rouses &lt;strong&gt;swamp-drainy&lt;/strong&gt; thoughts and criticisms of the &lt;strong&gt;legacy
   media&lt;/strong&gt; on the Dem side (search term &lt;strong&gt;yang media blackout&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;left&lt;/strong&gt;, I like how Yang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a redistributionist scheme that &lt;em&gt;is more universal than
   anything we've seen before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems relatively peaceful, not war-hawky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open the Third Eye; Optics and Meta-Cognitive Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike the 'MATH' campaign thing and all that nerd stuff; I see
that Yang is a lawyer too, not an engineer or even a veteran
(C.f. Tulsi Gabbard) so I suspect how "in touch" with reality he is on
the physics of the world. Math is wallowing in abstractions; how does
this map to reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't matter to most people who just clamour against "CLIMATE
CHANGE" and view they have "SCIENCE" on their side without
understanding a thing about it, besides what they've heard, akin to
how most people accept the traditions/religions handed to them.
(&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm not denying climate change or criticizing
traditions/religions here, I'm just making a point about how people
accept/reject ideas presented to them...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The memes were with him...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(...but many were probably by top-down design)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I hope that this whole Yang ordeal encoruages people to
criticially evaluate the sources they get any information from.&lt;/p&gt;
