we're told &lt;em&gt;reading is good&lt;/em&gt; and having a large vocabulary is one way
to "sound smart". Heeded uncritically, the advise "read a lot" can
lead you to become more foolish and more vain than if you couldn't
read at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often talking to people does a lot more than reading books. There's
this idea in the Western world that books are these repositories of
&lt;strong&gt;facts&lt;/strong&gt; or "information". Obviously, books typically are filled with
words. But just &lt;em&gt;how to understand the meanings of these words&lt;/em&gt; isn't
always readily available. While a car's manual will be pretty
"literal" and straightforward, one could easily read a novel or watch
a movie with little to no idea about &lt;em&gt;who produced that work and for
what reasons&lt;/em&gt;. This is very important to know for interpreting many
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Search Engine View on Language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at a resource like Google books and/or Google N-grams, you
gain access to lots of information. You can see the earliest uses of
some words, when terms became more/less popular, and compare
frequencies of competing terms, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this, you can gain access to a lot of &lt;em&gt;facts&lt;/em&gt;, such as the word
such-and-such was used more often than some other word during some
period of time. Doing an activity like this, do you learn anything
about what sorts of &lt;em&gt;meanings&lt;/em&gt; people are expressing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In linguistics, there is this term "&lt;strong&gt;arbitrariness of the sign&lt;/strong&gt;" for
the idea that the spoken/written &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; of a word doesn't reflect
anything about what it expresses in of itself&amp;mdash;it is arbitrary.
For many, many words, there is a sense in which this is true. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we can take old word &lt;em&gt;forms&lt;/em&gt; and give them new meanings. For
instance, in 2020 in the USA, when we say "orange man", we all know
who this refers to. Likewise if I started to call people "sleepy" (or
"creepy") it would be understood that I'm probably not talking about
cute kittens taking naps or spooky skeletons on halloween. This old,
familiar terms have taken on new connotations in the present time. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we are &lt;em&gt;encouraged to throw around words&lt;/em&gt; recklessly. Signs
and slogans plaster every street corner. Really, these signs convey
the meaning something along the lines of "I think such-and-such are
the &lt;em&gt;good guys&lt;/em&gt;, and if you support such-and-such you're a &lt;em&gt;bad guy&lt;/em&gt;".
Add in specifics as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meanings First&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many sayings of wisdom point out the value of practicing silence
and/or seeking silence/solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words are not "neutral" things that are just "out there". A resource
like a bilingual dictionary is not sufficient for learning a second
language, though it may be a useful tool. In order to understand a
second language, you need to have lots and lots of exposure to
speakers of that language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While intaking a lot of words and learning how to use language well is
not a bad thing in of itself, it is also not necessarily &lt;em&gt;a good
thing&lt;/em&gt;. Just as potatoes might be the best thing to eat for one person
and lemon juice over chicken might be good for another, the diet of
what words we consume can likewise affect our "verbal wellbeing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Function of words does often affect form; common words
(including grammatical things like prepositions) across languages,
for instance, tend to be short. Technical words can be longer,
polysyllabic&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump is called "orange" because of his skin color;
Biden is called "sleepy joe" or "creepy uncle joe" by some critics&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

what others say and thus kind of follow what is going on, but I
understand that the election outcome isn't really something that is
under my control, so it is a waste of time and energy to get worked up
over following it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy I am describing here&amp;mdash;just talking to friends and
stuff but not watching the news&amp;mdash;goes beyond "not watching TV"
(and instead looking on the Internet). Indeed the Internet is
plastered with election stuff all over the place. We temporarily have
a new "favorite American past time" (which many non-Americans seem to
take a lot of interest in as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, you cannot just "go on the Internet but not read about election
stuff" if you simultaenously visit popular websites like Facebook or
Youtube. One must more actively filter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts about elections generally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is amateur political philosopher hour! Today's topic is &lt;em&gt;why I
don't like elections&lt;/em&gt; as a way of governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the machinations of elections rely on techniques like
&lt;strong&gt;flattery&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;deception&lt;/strong&gt;. No matter who your preferred political
candidates are, you must recognize how large elections necessarily
involve lots of propagandizing to &lt;em&gt;get numbers&lt;/em&gt;. Numbers are
important, so you have to appeal to the &lt;em&gt;lowest common denominator&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, elections put pressure on people to &lt;em&gt;get involved in deciding
stuff for other people&lt;/em&gt; that they may have no business deciding. I
know nothing about... water rights in Nevada. But some stuff I vote on
may have big implications for that? Someone with a career in political
things might urge me to "get educated" and be active learning about
this-and-that. But for people who are not professional political
analysts, this is really not feasible. At best, you can find someone
you like and trust with good character who follows politics and follow
their voting patterns. Regardless, nobody pays you to do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, elections are a huge waste of time, energy, and resources.
Insofar as US dollars actually are money in the sense that they
represent value/work done, elections and their side effects are
costly. These costs are recurrent costs as elections happen in cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the question of &lt;em&gt;how well elections actually do at
representing what people want&lt;/em&gt;. If most people want a justice in the
sense that crime is punished, a government that is not too intrusive
such that basic civil liberties are preserved, and reasonable taxes to
do stuff like maintain roads and provide utilities... do we really
need &lt;em&gt;elections?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common in the West for people to defend their current forms of
government as favorable because they are "the best thing we've got,
though all systems are imperfect". I think there is a strong bias here
mainly stemming from,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current system is familiar and so relatively comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming that technology, associated with post-Enlightenment
  thinking and models of government, has improved quality of life and
  that it would be impossible to have this without
  republics/democracies, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlightenment carciatures of other forms of government as totally
  depraved/evil/terrible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associated with the last point is the retort, "Oh so you would like to
live in Saudi Arabia?" without consideration of hwo
democracies/republics have been instrumental in propping up many of
the "third world dictators" we villianize today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 67</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-67.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-02T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-11-02T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-11-02:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-67.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many of the difficulties we face are those of our own choosing.

was a tough day for me in some ways, but the troubles I can think of
were all of my own causing. Doing web tech work, it is no mystery
today why I had to spend many struggling to make Internet technologies
do stuff. Nobody &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; me to choose staring at screens, shuffling
symbols and dealing with complex abstractions was a path I chose to go
down. And so, sometimes I must endure suffering that comes with that
type of work&amp;mdash;being humbled by not being able to solve some
problem quickly, sluggishness of body from sitting for long periods of
time, and a mind tired from focusing on details that will probably go
out of fashion within the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negligence is also a source of troubles. Failure to properly maintain
equipment can lead to dealing with the aftermath of equipment failure.
Likewise failure to maintain good habits and routines will lead to
slow decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agency in Failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is tempting to brag of &lt;strong&gt;agency&lt;/strong&gt; in success&amp;mdash;what
role &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; had to play in something that turned out well. Maybe a more
edifying direction to turn to is to see how I have had agency in all
the troubles I bring on myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of things we don't choose&amp;mdash;e.g. which famliy we're born
into, many aspects of our childhood/upbringing, and &lt;em&gt;accidents&lt;/em&gt; of our
personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, lots of things we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; choose and with a little introspection
it is not hard to see how we &lt;em&gt;could have done better&lt;/em&gt;. In retrospect,
probably most people would be delighted if they could have "magically"
made it such that they studied such-and-such language, or maintained
relationships with so-and-so, or practiced some skill. On a day to day
basis, though, we neglect to do many things that we might wish we had
done if we could get these things for "free".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing to go to school will bring homework upon you (especially if
you choose a demanding major). Likewise, getting oneself into social
obligations might be costly in terms of you having "time to yourself"
for silence, reading, writing, reflection, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially for those that gain freedom to "make their own way" (e.g.
by living on their own) the responsibility of freedom becomes heavier.
While a grade school kid can legitimately say "the government forced
me to go to school", the "college aged" will typically have a weaker
case to make saying that they were "forced" into higher education or
some other arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insofar as we claim agency in our success, I'm thinking we should
probably even more so claim &lt;em&gt;agency in our failures&lt;/em&gt;. We play a huge
part in being the authors of our troubles until we decide to turn away
from being our own worst enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing our agency in failure means also recognizing our agency to
choose &lt;em&gt;not to fail&lt;/em&gt; when similar trials come our way. Whereas one
might have made bad choices in the past from failing to do research
and being too passive, or conversely being overly confident and
aggressive&amp;mdash;there is a common denominator which is &lt;em&gt;how we choose
to live day by day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some ways in which I "shoot myself in the foot"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the main ways I cause trouble for myself is by
"spreading myself too thin"; that is, trying to do too many things and
thus becoming a "jack of all trades, but master at none". This is
evident in my language study; I've spent many hours studying a lot of
languages, but am probably less &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; for most practical
language-related applications than someone bilingual in say... English
and Czech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related issue is that I lack &lt;em&gt;refinement&lt;/em&gt; in many areas. I can pull
of a "good enough/functional" in many areas but then get distracted by
other things and thus &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; not to put in the time to "finish what
I've started".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some things, I think I work fairly hard, but in other ways, I am
often relatively negligent. For instance, I'm only beginning to get
involved in the arts of physical training but I've spent many years as
a somewhat chunky nerd. Like many Americans, I am not too practiced in
many forms of &lt;em&gt;(rote) memorization&lt;/em&gt;. I'm relatively skilled at a
handful of forms of "reading" (e.g. scripts of various languages,
software documentation, music...) but am quite underdeveloped in
recitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are probably many more ways in which I undermine myself
which I will explore in later posts. The things mentioned here are a
recurring source of me choose failure, however, so I think it is worth
putting in writing here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 66</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-66.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-31T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-10-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-10-31:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-66.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learning a new domain of any sort will involve learning new

terms&amp;mdash;sometimes called (technical) &lt;strong&gt;jargon&lt;/strong&gt;. One challenging
aspect of doing this is that you will often have to "overload" words
you already use/know&amp;mdash;learn a new specialized application of some
word form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is an "Object" in programing? For each programing language that
uses "Objects" in some way, there is a different answer to this
question. In JavaScript, versus Ruby, versus C++ (and so and so forth)
you will find that the technical meaning of &lt;em&gt;object&lt;/em&gt; differs. To make
matters more confusing, we use the word "object" in everyday speech,
e.g. talking about "objects in a room" or even "speaking objectively".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversations can fail in many ways when people use the same word
forms (sounds, spellings) but fail to share the same &lt;em&gt;meanings&lt;/em&gt;. In
relatively concrete domains, such as cooking, I think this is
relatively rare. Saying, "please pass the salt shaker" or "this recipe
calls for two potatoes" will be pretty easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When moving into realms that involve more abstractions and difficult
to name things, however, problems proliferate. In the programing
example given above, we can see how words like &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;evaluate&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; cannot be naively transferred from natural
speech into code. Even English speakers have to learn new, precise
meanings of these terms in the domain of computer programing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way it is silly to say "why don't we make XYZ language
keywords in computer language ABC to make it more accessible to
such-and-such minority group"&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; has to learn new uses
for symbols when learning programing and the idea that you just do it
in "plain" English is a non-starter. People are not computers. What is
an &lt;code&gt;esac&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;fi&lt;/code&gt;?!?!?!? &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mass media, various words/terms are used to attempt to program
&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; like a computer. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Associating a term with very bad feelings
(e.g. &lt;strong&gt;facism&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;alt-right&lt;/strong&gt;) and then attaching this label to
someone/something is an easy way to quickly convey the message &lt;em&gt;XYZ is
bad&lt;/em&gt;, even if the viewer doesn't have any idea about what &lt;em&gt;XYZ&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;on
their own terms&lt;/em&gt;. Similarly, there are terms that the mass media uses
to instinctively train "positive" reactions&amp;mdash;consider
&lt;strong&gt;democracy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;rights&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;liberation&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that such-and-such &lt;em&gt;defends democracy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;protects human
rights&lt;/em&gt; and leads to the &lt;em&gt;liberation&lt;/em&gt; of such-and-such-group from
&lt;em&gt;extremists&lt;/em&gt; [...] is just a formulaic way to get people conditioned
to repeat slogans. Uncriticially convinced they are on "the right
side" of history, you get people marching for the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea taking for granted that it is &lt;em&gt;democratic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;of
the people&lt;/em&gt; and that it is indeed &lt;em&gt;a republic&lt;/em&gt; (I can accept that it
is on the Korean peninsula, lol). &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the solution to all this confusion? One thing to do is to
&lt;em&gt;refrain from talking about stuff you don't understand and/or is none
of your business&lt;/em&gt; (most stuff on the news) and to focus instead on
learning some skill/domain, which will very likely involve learning
lots of specialized vocabulary. I don't know much about &lt;em&gt;cars&lt;/em&gt;, but I
am guessing that somebody who does know about cars very often
face-palms at non-"car people" driveling on about car matters they
evidently know nothing about. Regarding car things, it is better if I
listen and just honestly say that I made some decision trusting some
authority, rather than pretending I know about what I'm talking about.
Of course, I could do my own hands-on research reading my car's
manual, watching some YouTube, poking around my car...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key words used in some scripting languages. Note all programing
languages will have this-and-that syntactic requirements, like
opening and closing parentheses; these are "artifacts" of the
technology/form of computer programing just like human speech
is shaped by the form of our mouths, noses, etc&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abusing word forms and their associations often appears as the

us making progress on the main thing at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, you may want to &lt;em&gt;eat a healthier diet&lt;/em&gt;. The solution to
this is not hard&amp;mdash;you can find someone who knows what they are
doing and &lt;em&gt;copy what they do&lt;/em&gt;. The alternative nerd thing to do would
be to lie to yourself and say that by reading XYZ chemistry books and
blah-blah-blah you are somehow making progress at your stated goal.
The solution is already before you if you will be humble enough to
learn from someone who perhaps has read fewer books and received lower
marks in school than you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you have some need of &lt;em&gt;tracking some data&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;let's
say where you planted some tomatoes. The quickest way to record this
information may just be to create a simple diagram. Later, you can
digitalize this, compile photos into a blog post, or whatever you
would like to do. To just move on and do more work, however, the low
tech solution of filling out some manual chart (or using a spread
sheet program you are familiar with) or just making a sketch on a
piece of paper may the most effective course of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low tech solutions often are helpful because they don't force us to
make needless categories. If you just pull out a piece of paper and
start writing you won't think about all sorts of nerd questions like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which format to save the document in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;which keyboard layout to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how often to save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how/where to make backups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing the simple, but perhaps "slower" solution may be the fastest
way to make a draft of something you can later refine, redistribute,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lern 2 code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern world, many young people are graduating high school or
college thinking about what to do. "Should I do &lt;em&gt;coding?&lt;/em&gt;" they ask.
Then, many struggle to find motivation to continue to learn python or
JavaScript or whatever&amp;mdash;and they are burdened by the thought that
&lt;em&gt;they should be learning&lt;/em&gt; because "coding" is supposed to be useful
for getting a &lt;em&gt;good job&lt;/em&gt;, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers are tools and having knowledge in some scripting or
something can be useful for automating processes. However, for most
people most of the time, the coding itself will not be the
"bottleneck" that prevents actual work from getting done in the world.
It is for this reason that you see many non-coder people running
YouTube channels, Wordpress sites, etc. and being far more effective
on using the Internet to get things done that symbol shuffling nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To "learn to code" is to learn how to formalize problems in the real
world in a particular way&amp;mdash;such that some computational solution
can be applied to them. For example, you may do some buying and
selling; to automate some process, what you may have to do is design
some chart that automatically does some arithmetic. You could do this
in Excel, using some web programing, or even in some ancient software
like Emacs. What is most important, however, is that you do a good job
designing that initial table that you "translate" into code. A few
minutes of careful planning with pen and paper can save hours of
stupid-coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 64</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-64.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-27T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-10-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-10-27:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-64.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Often, in sunny California, you will run into slogans plastered around

&lt;li&gt;VOTE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, looking into just &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; is giving these messages and what they
want, it is not difficult to discern just &lt;em&gt;what sorts of things&lt;/em&gt; they
want you to read, &lt;em&gt;what sorts of things&lt;/em&gt; they want you to speak, and
&lt;em&gt;how they want you to vote&lt;/em&gt;. If what you had to say was contrary to
what they were saying and it had the potential "critical mass" to
say... change the course of an election, well you wouldn't expect this
sort of messaging now, would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it matters &lt;em&gt;what you read&lt;/em&gt;, not just that you &lt;em&gt;do read&lt;/em&gt;. At
a beginner stage, it may be useful to read any words to get used to
the sounds/spelling/etc of a language, but even so you wouldn't want
to delve into reading mind-warping stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;em&gt;to speak&lt;/em&gt; usually requires that you practice saying some
words. But you can do useful/normal things like ask everyday life
questions and use language to do work rather than recite potentially
occult incantations "just for fun".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filtering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in an age where we are often told &lt;em&gt;more is better&lt;/em&gt;. If someone
has read a bunch of Wikipedia, many people will regard this person as
a rather broad-minded, learned person. The acquisition of
&lt;strong&gt;trivia&lt;/strong&gt;(l) knowledge is a favorite activity of bar nights, &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
particularly among the self-proclaimed nerd/geek types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pride in uselessness&amp;mdash;e.g. just &lt;em&gt;reading for the sake of reading&lt;/em&gt;
is &lt;em&gt;no bueno&lt;/em&gt;. In my own life, I've studied a bunch of languages. Is
that a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing? If I don't do anything useful with this
knowledge, I'm pretty much just wasting my time&amp;mdash;though it could
be worse. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I don't even tell other people to go study a second
language if they haven't started it, despite having practiced this for
many years. Maybe they have learned something else useful that I don't
know how to do (e.g. how to maintenance on cars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is better to &lt;em&gt;filter&lt;/em&gt; and guard ourselves against things that are
not good to see/hear/dwell on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language learning can be a "neutral" activity that can be used
for good; e.g. working out to build a strong body&amp;mdash;we can use
the abilities we train for good or evil.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in order to direct my activities &lt;em&gt;away from being lazy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, there is the most obvious sort of work&amp;mdash;physical labor
to achieve some tangible end. For instance, you may have to move some
supplies up a mountain or dig a ditch to redirect some water.
Organizing your labor (e.g. using your hands, operating tools) to do
this is an important, universally recognized sort of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the USA, in our present "digital age", many people don't do much of
this sort of work. Particularly if you're living in some urban
apartment, the closest thing you may do to approximate this sort of
job is cleaning your living space or cooking yourself a meal. So what
sort of work is there left for us to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defining "work"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any kind of work, there is some "default" state of things that you
have to exert attention and effort to change. Modern science jargon
might call this &lt;strong&gt;entropy&lt;/strong&gt; which biological organisms fight against.
So in the manual labor examples given above, &lt;em&gt;by default&lt;/em&gt; there is no
food/supplies at the top of a mountain&amp;mdash;through working, we can
make some store of food/supplies at the top of a mountain where these
things would normally not be found. Similarly, normally, the flow of
water would not respect crops planted in some area. By doing work, we
redirect water from where it would go by default such that it flows
where we intend it to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work means applying will, body, and intellect to change how things
are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training as work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, as given in the physical labor examples above, work is
enacting changes on the physical environment. But we probably wouldn't
want to say that "working out/exercising" isn't some kind of work
because activities like that are involving the &lt;em&gt;application of will,
body, and intellect to change how things are&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than changing
how water flows in a field, other activities may change how &lt;em&gt;we are&lt;/em&gt;
in form, skill, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a kind of work that involves &lt;em&gt;learning how stuff is put
together&lt;/em&gt;. How to build a bridge, how to analyze the grammar of a
language, how to operate some sort of machinery&amp;mdash;these are things
that we don't know by &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt;. It is only through the application of
will, body, and intellect. This may mean forcing ourselves to pay
attention and read some text even if we'd rather go take a nap or eat
a burger; the &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; is in choosing activity that goes against some
resting state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding work to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all this COVID stuff, many but not all people have some kind of
job in the sense of &lt;em&gt;role you fulfill for money&lt;/em&gt;. Not having some kind
of money-making occupation can be a point of great pain for many
people&amp;mdash;when I transitioned to my current day job (web developer)
I endured a period of being NEET (Not Employed in Education or in
Training) for some months&amp;mdash;at least on paper/institutionally. In
fact, I was never NEET for too long in the sense that while looking
for jobs and stuff I would work on training my nerd skills and stuff.
So I was "working" in the definition as presented here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of us can look at ourselves and our present situations and ask,
"what is it that needs work?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it will be obvious what needs to be done&amp;mdash;e.g. if your
room is really messy such that you can't find things you need, the
work you should probably do is cleaning your room. You will probably
know if you are neglecting to do some physical work on
yourself&amp;mdash;e.g. there is some walking/running you ought to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of &lt;em&gt;intellectual&lt;/em&gt; work, we can take inventory of what we do
and what we don't know and fill in knowledge gaps as is appropriate.
For instance, writing English, I rarely if ever make reference to a
dictionary unless I'm doing something specific like citing the
etymology of a word. Not so with the languages I've studied as second
languages&amp;mdash;I know that there is a lot of work for me to do to
make using these languages "comfortable" to use such that using them
ceases to be "work".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you &lt;em&gt;memorize&lt;/em&gt; information you usually look up (e.g. cooking
  recipes, some musical piece, a poem, prayers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you extemporaneously provide an explanation for something you
  are required to know (e.g. can you pass the "whiteboard interview")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you write a book, create a website, or otherwise &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;
  organize information you know?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Too fast, too slow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer I'm presently writing from isn't a particularly fast
computer. Using "modern" apps (e.g. web browsers, Discord) I have
crashed this computer many times. But if I stick to dinosaur-style
software usage (e.g. my text editor, browser without many tabs open),
then I'm fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for getting writing done, this is a very "fast" computer. I
use it as a digital typewriter/publishing machine as well as an
occasional dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were still a student and had a writing homework assignment, I
wouldn't hesitate to hop onto this computer to get stuff done. Trying
to get writing done on a super fast gaming rig with all sorts of fun
games and distracting apps would not be very conducive to hammering
out some prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identify the task at hand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than just hanging out with a computer, I've found that it is
helpful to first take a moment or so to &lt;em&gt;remember why I am&lt;/em&gt; going on
the computer in the first place. The answer to this question could be
&lt;em&gt;to socialize&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;to play games&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;what is important is that &lt;em&gt;you
recognize your intentions with using your tools (computer, phone,
etc.)&lt;/em&gt; such that a few hours pass and regret how you spent your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a computer, one can do many things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rest/Play&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat with friends, maintain networks/communications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play video games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment with software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make memes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study a foreign language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read/annotate a book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write programs to get work done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile research into shareable writings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do system maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data processing, analysis (e.g. doing something useful with a
  spreadsheet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping a log/diary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are many things you can do with a computer that
would likely be more difficult to do with only a pen/paper. Especially
when it comes to sharing the work you have done, digital information
technology is very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Distractions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers &lt;em&gt;should not&lt;/em&gt; be used as a distraction/coping mechanism. Are
you logging on the computer &lt;em&gt;to distract yourself from doing XYZ
chores?&lt;/em&gt; It may be time to shut up, get up, and do the work that is in
front of you rather than &lt;strong&gt;derping&lt;/strong&gt; around on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you are getting caught up in some Internet
argument&amp;mdash;you can ask yourself&amp;mdash;"to what end am I doing
this?" If the answer to this question is to &lt;em&gt;stroke your ego (by
showing the world how smart you are)&lt;/em&gt;, or to make somebody feel bad...
...well you should probably go do something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not a "Luddite"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not an advocate of just trashing all the technology and returning
to being a "caveman". However, I also think that we shouldn't
uncritically embrace new technology as "progress". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're all living in a particular time and place&amp;mdash;it is up to each
of us to choose to use what we've been given wisely.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 61</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-61.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-23T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-10-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-10-23:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-61.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Idle talk&lt;/strong&gt; is to be avoided; &lt;strong&gt;deceptive talk&lt;/strong&gt; (lying) is

prohibited. Having been writing blogs of rather informal character for
a while, it would not be challenging for me to just "post something"
everyday&amp;mdash;to practice of "producing content" for the sake of
content amounts to deciding on some schedule. Then, from that
schedule, there are endless things to talk about, particularly if you
are topically driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give an example&amp;mdash;suppose I started to write frequently on
the topic of Spanish (or some other foreign language). I could
document interesting new words I come across and provide short
summaries of more extensive research I do into etymologies and all
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of blog is a kind of technical &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;code&gt;blog = web + log&lt;/code&gt;)
and diary combination. It is a diary because it is written
&lt;em&gt;diariamente&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The driver for the content of this type of diary
is some &lt;strong&gt;work&lt;/strong&gt; outside the log itself (e.g. typesetting some book,
learning about some topic in order to do something). Words follow to
be a useful reference of some time whether that is to review later to
observe how progress has or has not been made or to refer to useful
documented information&amp;mdash;I might reproduce a tasty recipe in a
blog, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through an activity driven blog, you can make explicit &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you do
and (optionally) publish it for others to see if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a blog isn't just a collection of info, but provides
documentation of a journey. For example, in my experience learning
languages, I've found out lots of stuff that &lt;em&gt;didn't work&lt;/em&gt;. I've spent
time doing silly things like &lt;em&gt;learning alternative keyboard layouts&lt;/em&gt;.
A log of such foolishness can potentially be helpful for someone who
seeks to follow a similar path&amp;mdash;I'm not trying to sell you
products or anything and I don't claim "originality" to these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technical blog on programing, wood working, etc. can similarly be
informative. Actively working through problems and then posting
insights into what sorts of design patterns have(n't) worked, whether
the "next big thing" is just an old idea re-hashed, info on
tools/hardware... ...all this sort of information can be useful to
have and if you are looking at it anyways, I think writing a blog can
be a good way to serve others by providing non-nonsense takes on
things. However, it is &lt;em&gt;essential that you work&lt;/em&gt; and not just write
about stuff, because tools are tools and knowing the effectiveness of
tools means you have to use them to do work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regarding Political Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; that goes into a political blog? To &lt;em&gt;aggregate&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;analyze&lt;/em&gt; lots of information is an involved thing&amp;mdash;to do this
well, you can't just take news sites' word on "face value". You must
famliarize yourself with the actors/parties involved, who is paying
who, and so on and so forth. One might say, you have to become a
"&lt;strong&gt;conspiracy theorist&lt;/strong&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To think that most of news media is just a personal, technical log of
events like the kind of (work) blogs I describe above is
naivety&amp;mdash;one musn't be lazy/idle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish for "daily"&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

narration and reflection mixed in with notes on stuff I've been trying

"the normal routine" was shut down across the world, probably
beginning somewhere around Wuhan China. &lt;sup id="fnref:0"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't written for some time&amp;mdash;I don't want to write to just
contribute some &lt;em&gt;noise&lt;/em&gt; to the world. As evidenced by the fact that
I'm not using Medium&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or some other more easily "social" blog/article

&lt;em&gt;popular&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I hope this blog to be is &lt;strong&gt;edifying&lt;/strong&gt;. For me, it is a useful
tool to gather and present my thoughts on the things that are going on
around me and &lt;em&gt;keep me accountable for the choices I make to write my
life story&lt;/em&gt;. So, this blog is a kind of system of &lt;strong&gt;accountability&lt;/strong&gt;
for me. Am I causing needless trouble? Engaging in idle or vain talk?
The goal is that the answer to these questions is &lt;em&gt;"no!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; reading this and do what you need to do if
you aren't finding the words written here useful to you. My goal is to
&lt;em&gt;not waste your time&lt;/em&gt; but to help you use it better, sharing my
experiences so you can avoid mistakes I've made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grammar, Memory, Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been starting to do in-depth study of a few European languages.
Firstly, I'm studying Russian now, which involves learning a lot of
new grammar (e.g. memorizing noun declensions) and unfamiliar
vocabulary. I've learned the basic pronunciation of (modern) Greek to
be able to say and remember Greek words as I encounter them and I've
started to learn Latin as a way to understand the &lt;strong&gt;language arts&lt;/strong&gt;
more broadly. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that language study broadly fits under the category of
"wholesome activities"&amp;mdash;activities that are good (or at least not
harmful) to the soul. So while not working on something I have to take
care of (e.g. day job to make enough money to live off of, logistics),
I'm trying to make good use of my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/index.html"&gt;Language and
Linguistics&lt;/a&gt;
website continues to be slowly built up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of Latin has a long history and knowing Latin
grammar/vocabulary opens up more doors to learn classic rhetoric,
poetry, and more.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;work&lt;/strong&gt;, in the case that the thing being practiced is applied
towards some end with effects in the real world&amp;mdash;e.g. you can
&lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; baking pizzas through your &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; of making pizzas to
please customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Nerd's Folly&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nerd has &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; but fails in &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, a nerd
may have lots of knowledge about health/fitness things in the sense of
&lt;em&gt;textbook learning&lt;/em&gt;. Failure to apply this knowledge in practice gives
this person the appearance of a &lt;em&gt;hypocrite&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;if they are soooooo
smart, then why can they not apply their theory for results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babbling on about theory before confirming it experientially by
putting it into practice can be very bad because it can &lt;em&gt;turn people
away from good theory&lt;/em&gt; as they look first at the character and results
its proponents put forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerds ought to inspect themselves and be humble. If they're smarter
than everyone about XYZ software, can they direct a software project
to produce something better than the existing solutions? Many people
&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; quietly labor in this way, doing quality work &lt;em&gt;not
through first announcing their theory&lt;/em&gt; but by gradually refining their
methods through tireless toil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Working Knowledge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge should be useful for some kind of &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;; that which isn't
can be called "idle", "speculative", etc. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work can be done on lots of things. There is work on developing
&lt;em&gt;ourselves&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Also, there is work on the external world for the
purpose of making money, getting food, moving from place to place,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When theory is in excess or in error, bad theory should be refuted and
discarded and good theory should be retained and put to practice. More
theory (not necessarily &lt;em&gt;new theory&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) should be sought out when
the the current theoretical resources are insufficient to accomplish
the work at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative need not be bad&amp;mdash;there are times when we have
to think of different possibilities of how something might be done
(or how something may have come), and then we make judgements or
decisions regarding these possibilies&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How a person will interpret this statement will depend on how
you interpret a person&amp;mdash;e.g. does a person consist of
mind/body/spirit?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might only know a certain amount of theory, e.g. a handful
of grammatical constructions in a foreign language, but know these
things well. Learning often consists of learning &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; theory of
that which is already known, rather than doing something like...
making a constructed language and coming up with a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; theory.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

since all the COVID-19 stuff got rolling is ramping up the intensity
of my foreign language studying. In this post, I am going to explicate
why I currently find studying European languages (mainly focusing on
Russian, some French/Spanish, a tad bit of German) more worth my time
than making progress studying the East Asian languages, which I've
already spent years studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I am finding that by studying the European languages, I
gain access to much &lt;em&gt;richer&lt;/em&gt; materials&amp;mdash;much of the content
you'll find in the East Asian languages (especially online) is
derivative of thinking better developed and articulated in Europe. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Thus, since I'm not living in East Asia, there's very little practical
value to get from studying these languages. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I'm not drawn to stuff like... Tang dynasty poetry or exploring
Buddhism more, it doesn't really make sense for me to invest time in
developing skills in the E. Asian languages beyond having
conversational (and maybe blogging) skill. Read all the way through
this article for some practical take-aways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modern Languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There used to be something that was fairly common in some circles
called "Classical education". People would learn how to read Greek and
Latin and would learn about the associated civilizations with these
languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't looked in depth into the history, but I think starting
especially around the late 19th century, there were big shifts in the
Western world towards studying modern languages. For many, that meant
French which was serving as the "language of diplomacy" as well as
being the language many writers, scientists, and other eminent
intellectuals used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Modern Languages are often &lt;em&gt;the only&lt;/em&gt; languages young students
have available to study in classes. It seems like we have lots of
spicy choices&amp;mdash;a large university may offer courses in languages
like Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Arabic or even Quechua (an indigenous
American language). &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what is the utility of studying modern languages? And, why are
anglophones so notoriously not interested in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the Anglophone overlords (e.g. some really bad brits, some
Americans with a lot of money and industry) have pushed the culture of
their societies everywhere. &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As with US dollars, English is used and
recognized nearly everywhere in the "belly of the beast" and where its
tentacles touch around the globe. The &lt;strong&gt;soft power&lt;/strong&gt; of the Anglophone
world (esp. its American manifestations through things like Hollywood
and now the big tech companies like Google, Facebook, ...Netflix)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, you'll get a nerd&amp;mdash;like myself&amp;mdash;who gets the
idea in their head, "well, I'm of Chinese ethnicity so I might as well
follow through and learn Chinese". Rather than finding my "rich
cultural heritage", I instead find a very shallow, low-brow accessible
culture and then &lt;em&gt;geopolitics&lt;/em&gt;. There is some fun and uniqueness to
studying any language, e.g. the sounds of those languages. But in
terms of the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; available in many languages&amp;mdash;well
sometimes it appears to be &lt;em&gt;feds all the way down&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Musical Comparison&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By in large, Asian pop music just copies already existing Western
genres. You can find skillfully executed vocals in Korean R&amp;amp;B, but it
is still basically just the American engineered R&amp;amp;B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you will find that in "classical music", you see
many different forms of music that don't follow the 3-7 minute
able-to-be-played-on-the-radio (with commercial breaks) format that
characterizes much of popular music today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of modern languages is often like hearing &lt;em&gt;the same 4 chords
mashed over and over again&lt;/em&gt; with a different language over it. That's
why it is so easy for people to do stuff like... cover Disney songs in
a whole bunch of different languages. Many modern languages can be thought
of as the "disneyfication" of languages. While there may be some
different in garment and skin color, if the semantics are just the
same voices talking, what new utility does a language offer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to study foreign languages, don't just be a dummy like
me and study a whole bunch of languages all expressing the same sorts
of things/ideas. This is okay to do if you have people around you with
whom it will be useful to use these languages (e.g. learning Hungarian
because you have a Hungarian co-worker spend many hours with). Rather,
study different languages with &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;have something you need
to use those languages for. Then, motivation to study will come
naturally. Here's some examples from my experience of how different
modern languages I study can be useful,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spanish&lt;/strong&gt; is often used in California and can be used to read
  non-Anglophone perspectives on things from primary sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;French/German&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to explore the thought of people from
  centuries past; this is a very inexpensive hobby as many materials
  are available on public domain (e.g. through Project Gutenberg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to study how the New World Order is being
  rolled out in a different land&amp;mdash;you can "jump the language
  barrier great firewall" &lt;sup id="fnref2:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even better, though, is to study some &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; first (or try
to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something, e.g. make friends with the people speaking a
different language at the local bakery), and then let your language
learning follow. I would say for lots of "cultural enrichment", you
don't even need to study a foreign language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll learn more from studying Shakespeare in depth than from
studying 2 years of Japanese. This is because you'll spend so much
time just fixated on forms (of characters, of the sound of the
language) studying Japanese, you won't be able to read anything
interesting at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: the wise monolingual speaker&amp;mdash;or someone using a second
language in accented/broken speech&amp;mdash;is much more edifying to
speak with than some clown who speaks seven languages with fluency.
Clickbait YouTube has countless examples of people showing off how
they can show off; does parroting some local flavor &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; you
anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, much of the reason why we have
"Chinese"/"Japanese"/"Korean" to study at all is because these up
and coming nation states in the 20th century sought to emulate the
European powers by creating standardized languages&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would not be the case for you if I hade a spouse,
neighbors, co-workers etc. who were more comfortable using one of
these languages; this isn't the case now, though.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://bilibili.com"&gt;bilibili.com&lt;/a&gt;, China's weeb central
site, to see how the Chinese nerd youth are being cultured&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref2:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called "neoliberals" and "neoconservatives" impose the
primarily Anglo debt driven illusion of liberty around the globe&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't catch it, making an allusion to the phrase
"turtles all the way down". Regarding feds, this is to say that
intelligence agencies would like to broadcast their messages in
many different languages through many different channels, whether
directly or indirectly.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

foreign cultures often dislike or feel alienated from the place they
themselves are from&amp;mdash;while wishing that people of the cultures
they admire do not become more cosmpolitan, they themselves contribute
to making these cultures more in their likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, you may get a linguist who is studying some
population XYZ. The linguist is most interested in talking to
monolingual speakers of XYZ and wishes to learn and understand the
culture of XYZ. However, the linguist is a foreign agent who
necessarily introduces foreign thinking/concepts/etc. upon contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Weeb&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the West, there are lot of people that have at least a superficial
interest in places/cultures that they themselves are not ethnically
connected with. For example, there are the &lt;strong&gt;weebs&lt;/strong&gt; who fawn after
all things Japanese. Weebs cringe at each other and the Japanese
cringe at weebs. But many people continue down weebdom as a path of
escapism from their issues they refuse to confront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a phenomenon called the &lt;em&gt;itasha&lt;/em&gt; or "painful to look at car".
Do a quick image search and you will see many examples of cars
plastered with anime stuff. Why would such a thing exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illustrator exercises control over the canvas they
control&amp;mdash;they can establish homogeneity of style, good
composition, consistency with some standards (e.g. &lt;em&gt;how some character
is supposed to look&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weeb seeks a perfect little ordered world&amp;mdash;even if
fictional&amp;mdash;which illustrators can depict. Rather than meeting the
people around them, the weeb turns to some 2D ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They watch Naruto train instead of training themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They drool over cooking mangas while not doing the dishes in their
  own living spaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They spend thousands of dollars on games, merchandise, etc. and fail
  to invest in their own futures&amp;mdash;the prototypical &lt;strong&gt;consoomer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They nostalgia LARP a childhood they never had (e.g. Japanese high
  school drama stuff)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, the weeb is self-loathing. So why does the weeb keep on
weebing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become a weeb is easy. All you do is choose escapism over work and
let your own psychology drive you deeper and deeper into obscure places.
For some, this may be spending hours creating lewd drawings for very
specific audiences. For others, this may be becoming insufferably
boring to talk to because of having a compulsive desire to share
details about a pantheon of 2D characters to any even slightly polite
ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weeb is able to find some beauty in the things of Japan,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fine craftsmanship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appreciation of the natural world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;law and order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ethnicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;arts/music celebrating simple, good things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If only we could be like (idealized) Japan?!&lt;/em&gt;, they wonder. Then,
they go to the voting booth and choose all the things that make them
disgusted by their own nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Redemption of the Weeb&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weeb chooses &lt;strong&gt;false idols&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;fictions made up by
men&amp;mdash;to place first and serve. Weebness may manifest in having
shelves covered with anime figuirines, meticulously cared for,
cleaned, etc. Computers may be configured all around the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;
of some fictional entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redemption of the weeb takes the same form as someone who worships
money, career/prestige, fame, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 56</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-56.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-09T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-09-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-09-09:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-56.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the city I grew up in, there were many unfamiliar symbols all

around me. Though I am of Chinese heritage, I did not learn Chinese
until I decided to do so myself as an "adult learner". So, returning to
places I spent time in as I grew up living with my parents, my
surroundings have become &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; more readable to me now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is often a fairly big "barrier to entry" to learn how to read
some new script. Particularly in the case of languages like Chinese or
Japanese, you have to learn to recognize unfamilar forms and associate
those forms with unfamiliar sounds. Once you pass the initial barrier
of getting started, however, you open up the floodgates to learn a
whole lot very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Living in a bilingual dictionary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't spend very much time at all actively studying Spanish.
However, just by living in California and taking the time to try to
decipher bits and pieces of written Spanish (materials/signs/etc. are
often translated), I feel pretty comfortable in (formal) Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other parts of the world have different sets of languages. In East
Asia, it is easy to study at once Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
because in major cities where tourists are likely to be you will often
see information presented in all three of these languages plus
English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you learn the basics of reading some other script and also know how
to look up unfamiliar words (whether on your phone or using paper
resources), you can quickly learn lots of vocabulary with very little
effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;시작이 반 이다.&lt;br&gt;
Starting is half the battle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An anecdote&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me share with you how I began learning Korean. Growing up through
grade school, I had many classmates of Korean ethnicity. One day, I
got bored in class, so I asked a classmate to show me how the Korean
writing system worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got very interested because I liked how Korean sounded and looked
and found Korean people pretty interesting too (they acted with
&lt;em&gt;intensity&lt;/em&gt;). Stashed away somewhere, I probably still have some of
the scraps of paper I used in those days I first started studying
Korean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in 2020, lots of "Korean" content is popular globally. I would
like to say that I started learning Korean "before it was cool". I
don't actually really care much for current Korean music, movies, etc.
(if I consoomed anything, it would be from decades past; 아저씨 처럼
나 옛날을 기억해).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to read and speak some Korean fairly early on in my life has
enabled me to not over-romanticize or chase Korean things &lt;em&gt;just
because they are foreign&lt;/em&gt;; Korean stuff in fact feels more familiar to
me than weird stuff like the American Top 40 chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code Switching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linguists have this term "&lt;strong&gt;code switching&lt;/strong&gt;" for when people drop in
words/phrases/etc. in another language. For example, I might say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's test was &lt;em&gt;no bueno&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bird pooped on my head. Am I angry? &lt;em&gt;C'est la vie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too is a means by which people can become familar with lots of
foreign language stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as it pains me to say, there are many weebs on the Internet
who are familiar with a fairly large number of Japanese words and
phrases from anime. From &lt;em&gt;sensei&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;senpai&lt;/em&gt;, meme shitposting
netizens all over the globe are making Japanese a kind of &lt;em&gt;lingua
franca&lt;/em&gt; of Internet weebdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;おまえはもう死んでいる&lt;br&gt;
Omae wa mou shinde iru.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The multilingual blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think that is a good idea to &lt;em&gt;preserve standard orthography
when possible&lt;/em&gt; as well as provide any &lt;em&gt;helpful information for
reading/interpreting foreign language words and phrases&lt;/em&gt;. That is why
for all the alphabet languages (including Korean) in this post I have
just used standard orthography. Anyone that cares enough about the
specifics to learn Korean can easily look stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For languages like Chinese and Japanese where you can't learn the
script so easily, it is helpful to have some kind of phonetic gloss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你看得懂没有？&lt;br&gt;
Nǐ kàn-de-dǒng méiyǒu?&lt;br&gt;
Can you understand what you are reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can type all sorts of languages without setting up anything fancy
on your computer using &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/inputtools/try/"&gt;Google Input
Tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this way of doing things is preferable over trying to invent
ad-hoc Romanization systems (or even using established, but not widely
known systems) &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There can be lots of confusion over different
transliterations, so presenting some foreign language stuff &lt;em&gt;only in
transliteration&lt;/em&gt; can lead to potential corruption of meaning/intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, preserving standard orthography means that it will
be easy for people that do want to find out more to find out more to
do so. If you're feeling generous, providing helpful information to
language learners is a considerate to thing too! &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenge for English speaking natives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't done so already, it probably won't take long to learn
the basics of reading French and German words. Here's two strategies
you can learn to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA); this isn't an
  obscure thing&amp;mdash;it is used all over Wikipedia, for instance, to
  describe how to pronounce names of things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch some introductory YouTube videos reading words in French/German&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never met anyone who has learned these things and thought it
was a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this would be the Yale Romanization system for
Korean, which I've used in at least a couple of my pages.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking accent marks for Russia, providing standard Pinyin
transcriptions for Chinese&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

working &lt;em&gt;towards&lt;/em&gt; something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Language Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to provide an example from language learning, a topic of at
least a few posts here. Now, the goal of most language learners of
modern languages is to gain communicational competence and hopefully
"sound native" in some target language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positive thinking learner focues on &lt;em&gt;what being a speaker of that
target language&lt;/em&gt; is. The most obvious way to do this is to &lt;em&gt;observe
the language being used&lt;/em&gt;. Real life face-to-face conversations are
best for learning conversation, of course, but videos, podcasts, and
other forms of media are pretty good too&amp;mdash;and often more
convenient when native speakers are readily available on a day-to-day
basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive thinking involves getting an increasingly clear idea of what
"using XYZ" language is. A person that does not speak Icelandic could
not give you examples of what Icelandic language usage is like because
they don't speak Icelandic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would negative thinking look like with respect to language
learning? Being focused on &lt;em&gt;finding one's errors&lt;/em&gt; and then coming up
with rules and explanations for why such and such is wrong would be
one way to see this.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rather fatalistic viewpoints have been advanced in linguistics.
One such idea is the "critical period"&amp;mdash;there is a certain time
window (usu. ends around age 13 or so) before which a person must
learn a language, or else they will never learn that language
"natively". This is probably true in many respects, particularly if we
involve discussion of trauma and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to tell a 16 year old high student that their Spanish &lt;em&gt;will
never be "native"&lt;/em&gt; is simply demoralizing and (I think) just plain
false. Resigning to the fact that language learning will be a futile
struggle and that achieving native-like command is impossible is a
recipe to lose sight of a very reachable goal&amp;mdash;visiting YouTube
you can find all sorts of very successful second language learners for
any major language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computer Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive thinking is important to empower computer users as well. You
may have met someone who had simply decided, "I'm not a computer
person" or "I don't do technology". &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is a kind of
self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don't expect everybody to be willing or able to troubleshoot
any computer problem that comes their way (and hence why I don't do
any "UNIX evangelism"), I do think certain workflows are accessible to
anyone who is capable of doing things like writing a short essay or
driving a car. It is not conceptually difficult to understand what it
means to,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send and recieve emails or messages on some chat service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use some sort of calendar (e.g. Google calendar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do basic word processing/writing (e.g. through MS word, or some
  boomer program like emacs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize files into folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having positive (projects) such as,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping a daily diary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining regular corresponce with some people/groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organizing a digital library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...will inform you on the skills you need to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solutions often don't need to be complicated. There are professional
programers whose computers are total messes outside of their
programing projects; clearly these people know how to deal with
complexity in some one domain, but they don't readily apply tools they
already know how to use to other more accessible domains. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In linguistics, finding "ungrammatical" sentences uses this
approach.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have principled reasons for not using computers, Internet
tech, smartphones, etc., I tip my (virtual) fedora to you.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For examples of "reformed nerds" you can find many examples of
engineering types deciding to apply their skills to stuff like
training as athletes later in their lives when they accept they
need to work on their physical health.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

href="https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/learning.html"&gt;language
learning&lt;/a&gt; page which has additional information on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I specifically discuss learning foreign languages here, I think
the topics dicussed here are sufficiently general that they could be
applied to all sorts of learned skills (e.g. computer programing,
playing piano, making bookshelves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice&lt;/strong&gt; is refining movements. &lt;strong&gt;Study&lt;/strong&gt; is becoming familiar
with models that are useful for practice (theory). When we are able to
do something or understand something we were not able to before, we
say we are &lt;strong&gt;learning&lt;/strong&gt; something. Through study and practice, we
learn. &lt;sup id="fnref:0"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you recognize a pattern (e.g. word, grammatical construction) you
can refine your movements. Learning the spelling and morphological
breakdown of a word, or a sentence structure can be called "studying"
in that you are learning the "theory" of how a language is put
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand what you are looking at, you can become familiar
with the specifics of how/when that form is used and refine your
movements reproducing that thing (whether through speaking, typing on
a keyboard, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amorphous blobs are impenetrable; they must be broken up ("analyzed").
When approaching something new, there may be overwhelming complexity.
Learning how to break down a very complex thing into smaller,
learnable pieces is how we acquire proficiency in using larger more
complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Language learning, early stages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When approaching a new foreign language for the first time, you are
approaching the aforementioned amorphous blob. You don't know where
word boundaries are, when you do recognize words you cannot tell how
they are related to surrounding words, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don't forget your theory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, you need some &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning by immersion often involves a patient native speaker (or a
computer program) giving you small, digestible pieces of information.
For example, you may learn how to name many of the things around you:
&lt;em&gt;tree&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bench&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;COVID-19&lt;/em&gt; (just kidding, but maybe not really).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, you can take a much more Western, direct approach and grab a
bound dead tree (book) and get an idea of what you're looking for. You
could watch YouTube or something like that as well, but you might have
to sift through a lot more noise before getting what you're looking
for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have something to look for (e.g. recognizing some top 100
words), you are already to start practicing. Typically in classrooms,
you will be drilled on producing/understanding basic sentences for a
while. This can be a decent approach if you get to use these sentences
in some memorable situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Media dumpster dive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the age of the Internet, you may get faster results using other
techniques. No matter what you do, focus on one thing at a time during
these early stages: e.g. grab a long video (2 hours) and just listen
for all the cognates that you can recognize. When you recognize a
word, repeat it to yourself so you can become familiar with the sound
of your target language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus&lt;/em&gt; is key. This is why you &lt;em&gt;shouldn't watch anime with subtitles&lt;/em&gt;
(you can find plenty of weebs who do this and know almost no
Japanese). What happens is that instead of focusing on the form of
Japanese, people lose focus and just read the subs. This is &lt;em&gt;no
bueno&lt;/em&gt;. If you MUST be a devout weeb, first watch with subtitles for
the meanings, then rewatch the video you're looking
at&amp;mdash;understanding what you're watching having already read the
subs&amp;mdash;and listen to the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memorize just enough, not too much&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning a new word &lt;em&gt;make sure to learn at least some of the
relevant information for using it correctly in context&lt;/em&gt;. For instance
in learning a European language like Spanish or German, you will have
to deal with grammatical gender. Do memorize the grammatical gender of
a word when you learn a new word. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good idea to &lt;em&gt;integrate your knowledge&lt;/em&gt; of lots of separate
things. For the East Asian languages, you may want to pay attention to
other words you know that share Chinese characters the word you are
learning. For instance, there is 내일 &lt;em&gt;nay-il&lt;/em&gt; 'tomorrow' and 일요일
&lt;em&gt;il-yo-il&lt;/em&gt; 'Sunday' which share 일 &lt;em&gt;il&lt;/em&gt; meaning 'Sun'. One could*
learn an East Asian language on sound only, but knowing the associated
Chinese characters makes acquiring more vocabulary much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can likewise integrate your knowledge &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt; languages for
related languages. For example, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean share a
lot of vocabulary&amp;mdash;much of which is the product of Japan first
modernizing during the &lt;em&gt;Meiji&lt;/em&gt; era and making up all sorts of new
words for Western imports. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Likewise, learning French or German
would probably be a pretty easy choice for a new foreign language for
a native English speaker. There are many similaries in grammar and
sound between English and German and French vocabulary is almost
&lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; to the English speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you don't want to do, however, is get &lt;em&gt;too caught up on details&lt;/em&gt;
such that you fail to do more important practice. The scarce resources
you are working with are &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;attention&lt;/em&gt;. One mistake I made
when starting to learn Chinese/Japanese/Korean was to get too focused
on the writing system and lagging behind in my listening and speaking
skills. I didn't have this problem with Spanish because I would listen
to Spanish language radio while driving in my car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond beginner level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, you will get pretty comfortable with most of the
grammar of a target foreign language. From this point on, the new
challenge is to expand your knowledge of vocabulary, learn idioms, and
other language-specific things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the basics in place, you can begin using your target language(s)
to further learn your target language&amp;mdash;learn in the same way that
native speakers deepen their command of their own tongues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:0"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not employ an "equality" of study and practice; there
are people that do more study, people that do more practice, etc.
Which you do more of depends on what your goals are.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some languages, you can most often tell the gender of a noun
by the form of the word, but this is not always the case. For
instance in Spanish, words that end in &lt;em&gt;-o&lt;/em&gt; are usually masculine,
but you have &lt;em&gt;las manos&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A linguist might quibble with you and say "Chinese, Japanese,
and Korean are not related" with some reference to syntax,
morphology, or something. Maybe, I dunno. But they share a lot of
vocabulary and that is good enough for me.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many nerds, life goes on pretty much as normal during covid &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Sure, you might have to wear a mask, but many nerds would probably
have preferred to hide behind a mask anyways, so now they can
simultaneous &lt;em&gt;virtue signal&lt;/em&gt; and conceal their smirks of disdain at
all the "idiots" around them acting less straight-laced than themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going around town, I can see that many people are doing their best
to cooperate with authorities and do a good, honest job wherever they
are. Every interaction I have had with store employees has been
pleasant; no troubles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From inside my bubble, things like OK logistically. The stock market
has had just... ridiculous prices. I haven heard anyone talk about
bitcoin being a bubble recently, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bubble Bursting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am describing are relatively peaceful parts of a relatively
nice part of California; other cities (e.g. Portland, New York
City...) are recieving a lot more... action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am assuming most people around me are employed in some way or
otherwise have the resources to not face fear of eviction. Major
employers in my vicinity include various government agencies and
hospitals. In other words, I am surrounded by very institutionally
embedded people as well as "normal" businesses like restaurants, gas
stations, laundromats, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poking around the Internets, I know that many people &lt;em&gt;are not doing
well at all&lt;/em&gt;. Probably lots of the people I'm connected with on social
media aren't going out so much&amp;mdash;the relatively pleasant
interactions I've had with people outside represent,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go-getters trying to improve themselves (e.g. seeing people while
  exercising outside)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with jobs (and thus taking care of at least some things
  financially)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People that &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to interact with the outside world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Predictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that we're going to see a "return to normal" anytime
soon in the sense that over the next few months we're going to see
lots of lasting changes. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Many dystopian trends we're seeing in
the USA have been here for... a long time. one might say they are
baked into the foundations of this nation. With changes in technology
and the expansion of the Internet into more and more places I think we
can expect,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More surveillance, everywhere. The more things that are hooked up to
  smart phones and/or the Internet, the more data we will generate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further consolidation of power for financial/technochratic elites.
  These people &lt;em&gt;are not independent of government&lt;/em&gt; (so don't try some
  lame "muh free markets!" argument) &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further erosion of constitutional rights (e.g. right to assemble,
  right to bear arms) &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people will be trapped out alone, isolated&amp;mdash;consider for
  example recent college graduates who have maintained employment in a
  new city; they may opt to continue living in that new city despite
  the remnants social life continuing to waste away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawn out indecisiveness; most people don't want to get in trouble
  breaking the law and the current way stuff is laid out, it is
  difficult to move fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-6.html"&gt;some
predictions&lt;/a&gt;
about covid stuff back in May of this year). Overall my predictions
moving forward are more grim, but not in contradition with those made
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more predictions for the coming months,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;America as a whole will continue to drift "blue"/Democrat;
  Californians will leave California and bring their politics where
  they go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Trump wins, he may be our last Republican president for a long
  time (or ever); we can expect massive media
  outrage/scandal/rioting/etc if Trump wins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Biden wins, I expect to see a short-term "return to prosperity".
  This might mean covid mysteriously "ending" or some vaccine being
  rolled out. What will follow is increased socialism, surveillance,
  and everything inbetween&amp;mdash;basically leading the USA towards a
  totalitarian secular state. &lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will see more rioting in US cities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We may see the formation of new police-like forces by "community
  organizers"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not think we will see a large, unified "right wing" defense; we
  will see small, local efforts, but nothing like a large militia
  fighting off protestors, at least in the coming few months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think many of the businesses that have survived this far will
continue to survive; tech companies, banks, etc. will also continue to
consolidate power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preparing for the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no better time than now to make peace with those around you,
build/maintain your networks, and work on yourself than now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Landowners&amp;mdash;what do you think a nation of broke millennials
  will vote in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Renters&amp;mdash;do not squander your time/resources on things that may
  not be there tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connections, skills, and of course good character will take you far
&lt;em&gt;in any world&lt;/em&gt;. The world we are heading into will not be the "Boomer
economy" those before us have known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not even going to bother capitalizing/typesetting "COVID-19"
anymore; you all know what I'm talking about.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As communists will point out, capitalism is useful for building
up infrastructure, wealth, etc. Depending which sort of communist
you're talking to, this wealth generated by creative energy can
then be controlled through monopoly and the monopoly can be
collectived, or something like that.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, I am not one of these people who believe the Constitution
is a moral/binding document. It requires a certain sort of society
to work in and if the population of the US is collectively
deciding against protecting individual freedoms, we can expect to
see them disappear. I'm sure you can find some quotes about
defending liberty this-and-that from some founding father people
if you do some searching.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can follow some kinda hippy, new-age "all is one"
religion. But there won't be "religious freedom" like how many
people still think of it; consider what you may have heard about
"Christians being persecuted in China". I think we can expect a
similar situtation developing in the US; indeed during covid,
freedom to assemble has already been restricted for a long time&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquire an old text, translated into many languages. Some
   suggestions are: pick a favorite Psalm or Proverb from the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the basic pronunciation of your target language(s); one trick
   is to find a YouTube …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here, I will share a technique for learning language(s) in a wholistic

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquire an old text, translated into many languages. Some
   suggestions are: pick a favorite Psalm or Proverb from the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the basic pronunciation of your target language(s); one trick
   is to find a YouTube video reading a whole bunch of introductory
   sentences. Follow along and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memorize your (hopefully edifying) text in all your target
   language(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you can, practice recalling what you have memorized. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique is cool because it gives you a structured way to expose
yourself to a lot of different grammar/vocabulary with &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; that
you ought to be thinking of and remembering anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the above approach for a while, you'll get a very good "feel"
for your target language and can branch out to reading new texts,
listening to new content, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Aspects of Language Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of languages will be particular to a cutlure, group, etc.
So, if you want to speak &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; new language conversationally, you're
going to have to learn a handful of frequent words and phrases anew.
This is true even for so-called &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/essays/constructed.html"&gt;"artificial
languages"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above technique requires some &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; too; you may have to learn a
new writing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there's non-verbal cultural stuff to learn. Between some
languages, this isn't really an issue&amp;mdash;good people will
acknowledge sincerity in conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're studying more than one language, you might have to
   mentally space your day up like "study Spanish before noon",
   "Japanese until sundown" or something like that to get yourself out
   of the "tyranny of choice" of which languages to study.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one good thing that is coming out of all this C'Rona stuff is
that many people have come to question their "old" lifestyles of half
a year or so back and are rediscovering what it is that they value
most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I've been given the opportunity to reach out and contact
people in what otherwise might be overly "busy" times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investing in stuff that isn't Federal Reserve notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, having lots of dollars in the US is helpful for stuff like
getting food, shelter, transporation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is not difficult to see how &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; "storing up earthly
treasures" is not a wise solution for the forward looking person. What
if you owned a ton of real estate, and then communists took over? You
would probably either (1) lose your land, or (2) become the corrupt
oligarch you never wanted to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you went through college, got all A's, but didn't make any
friends/connections? Indeed, that's what a lot of people will probably
do in online schooling these days.&lt;/p&gt;

Christianity further. So far, it has been an overwhelmingly positive
experience. In this post, I relate one way in which Orthodox Christianity (as
opposed to other varieties I've been involved with, Protestant groups) has thus
far presented itself as a sustainable, robust, &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Of Arch Linux and Orthodoxy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road that led me to do a more serious investigation of Orthodox
Christianity is something as follows, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was aware that Orthodoxy existed from investigating Protestant
  conceptions of the afterlife (heaven/hell), but put these issues on
  the back-burner to take a break from religion and pursue normal
  career stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After four years or so of wandering around in academia, trying to figure
  out what to do with my life, I quit and got normal work doing tech/nerd
  stuff (web programing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I joined the &lt;a href="http://xahlee.info"&gt;Xah Lee&lt;/a&gt; discord chat server (still active
  there) to have people to chat with about tech/programing and well as general topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One Internet friend I tended to disagree with on a lot of things, continued
  to blame many of the world's ills on Russia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, on my web page on
&lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/languages/russian/index.html"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt;
I mention this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian often gets a bad reputation in the United States (e.g. "Russian
collusion"; in contrast, have you heard about "Japanese collusion"?!). One of
the reasons I'm motivated to study Russian is that many people I tend to
disagree with on matters of opinion often have an... instinctive dislike for
Russian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...so I looked into some things on Russia to learn just &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this fellow might
have such strong feelings against Russia. I had overall positive feelings about
Russia at this point because I enjoyed reading Dostoevsky and Tolstoy as an
undergraduate and always liked the sound/look of the Russian language and
Cyrillic script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, an investigation into Russia in current times will lead to many
mentions of the Orthodox church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Internet friend recommended me &lt;a href="https://jaysanalysis.com"&gt;Jay Dyer's&lt;/a&gt;
content, which I linked on my &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-49.html"&gt;previous blog
post&lt;/a&gt;.
Jay does long-form, in-depth analyses of lots of issues including theological
topics.  Jay's content led me to go investigate Orthodoxy in real life as well
as through chatting with friends I met outside the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, being a professional nerd (programer) led me to an online chat group, in
which a guy kept on blaming the Russians. This led me to look into Russia which
led me to look into Orthodoxy. Other friends helped link me to various stuff,
share books, etc. Note, much of this searching was done &lt;em&gt;without Google&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Linux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is time to talk about Linux, and in particular my experience with &lt;a href="https://www.archlinux.org/"&gt;Arch
Linux&lt;/a&gt;. The main way I see using Linux and Orthodox
Christianity is as follows: both give a path for how to &lt;em&gt;not do wrong&lt;/em&gt; in a
particular domain (i.e. have a working, functional system in Arch Linux; living
a life free of sin in Christianity). Beyond this, the user (&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;) is free to
celebrate the life you've been given through choosing any number of paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there is a big difference of &lt;strong&gt;scope&lt;/strong&gt; here (Arch Linux falls under
life; it is certainly possible to sin in a Christian sense while using Arch
Linux, lol). But some interesting parallels do hold, which I will expound on
below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learning stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another person I've linked a bunch is &lt;a href="https://lukesmith.xyz"&gt;Luke Smith&lt;/a&gt;. Luke
Smith unironically has a Christian tech channel. His more interesting stuff to
me are his discussions in his &lt;em&gt;Not Related!&lt;/em&gt; podcast where he's talked about
stuff like rationality, the scientific method, statistics, and history of the US.
One thing that Luke got me into was setting up Arch Linux; I have basically
transcribed one of his videos into my own &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html"&gt;Arch Linux installation
tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn about using computers/tech, Luke has emphasized many points I agree
with,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the manual/documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask questions, see what has been done already&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't get caught up in fervor about your new shiny this-or-that; be critical
  of how newer or flashier solutions (e.g. GUI wrapper for some command line
  tool) may &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be an improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be humble and learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Luke's content, I came to develop a lot of the views I have on
technology and society. One topic he has touched some on is how to &lt;em&gt;learn to
use Linux&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;or in internet slang, "git gud". &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who uses Arch frequently will know of the &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/"&gt;Arch
Wiki&lt;/a&gt;, a resource that is so useful that even
non-Arch users will frequently use it to help them troubleshoot issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn how to do things in Linux, one could try to read all the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt;
(manual) pages for various tools. In earlier decades, it was quite possible to
get a basic sense of what was going on this way. But practically speaking, you
don't want to redo all the work of other people that have already put in
hours and hours troubleshooting issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, I was pleasantly surprised to find a very well-sourced, readable
&lt;a href="https://orthodoxwiki.org/Main_Page"&gt;Orthodox Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. Just as someone might
consult the Arch Wiki to find out information on some cryptic command, one
would use the Orthodox Wiki to learn about teachings on some particular issue, 
the history of a particular parish, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians (e.g. the Church Fathers) have worked through lots of
problems&amp;mdash;many very deep ones, e.g. metaphysical questions&amp;mdash;over many
centuries. I've been very impressed by the depth and breadth of knowledge
transfer from generation to generation in the Orthodox world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I document my journey in hopes that it may be useful to others. It is
already interesting for me to look back on my old blog posts during this whole
COVID thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all my readers who have been following this blog, whether
sporadically or reading every post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tbh covid has been pretty fortuitous to me; e.g. it has given me this
opportunity to pause from running around, and think not just about career stuff
for my own life, but to look forward into what kind of life/community I would
like to give future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Geopolitics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I've mentioned on this blog once or twice about my interest in
looking into more Orthodox Christianity stuff. Some issues with
(Evangelical) Protestantism I've tried to work through, in no
particular order&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philosophical problems (e.g. problem of evil; what is "belief" in
  &lt;em&gt;sola fide&lt;/em&gt;; where does scripture come from in &lt;em&gt;sola scriptura?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of tradition, historical roots; many songs/images/etc of modern
  Christian movements look like whatever advertising is popular.
  Constant new materials instead of engaging classic works &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uninspiring/bad aesthetics ("hippie rock concert")&amp;mdash;doesn't
  &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; holy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that through spending some time studying Orthodoxy, including
doing more readings of the Church Fathers &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diving into the work of content creators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 or so, there's been a handful of content creator people's
work I've engaged a lot. Each, I've found especially engaging for some
personal reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, on this blog, I've shared some links to the work of &lt;a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/"&gt;Luke
Smith&lt;/a&gt;. A bit older than me, I was surprised
to see how he had similar thoughts that I did about stuff that I did,
and went further doing more homework/research and producing more
content on these topics than I had done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pretty much no news has been good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending more time reading books, talking with people, etc. has been
very good. I only keep up with enough news to know what I'm allowed
to/not allowed to do, and often I can find this out through &lt;em&gt;other
people&lt;/em&gt; without even opening social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some practical suggestions for making media consumption a better use
of time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make default homepages on your web browsers blank or something
  really dry and boring (e.g. the weather in California)&amp;mdash;this
  shields you from getting attention splashed with what others push on
  you; you can start your Internet interaction with what you decided
  to look at&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever possible, consume &lt;em&gt;older&lt;/em&gt; media first&amp;mdash;choose a novel
  from 50 years ago rather than 5 years ago. One upside of consuming
  older media is you can probably find more informative
  commentary/analysis as well (e.g. reviews on old movies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever possible, consume &lt;em&gt;longer form&lt;/em&gt; media* if you are
  interested in a subject; e.g. if you're going to express an opinion
  about Afghanistan, see if there is some old book by someone on
  Afghanistan and read that rather than assuming you understand the
  context of some rando Twitter remark. If you are unwilling to do
  your homework, don't be an echo chamber conduit if you don't have to
  be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump past the first Google results &lt;em&gt;purposely&lt;/em&gt;; try to go to
  &lt;em&gt;anywhere other than Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt; first. Then, go to Wikipedia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you choose to browse news sites, &lt;em&gt;intentionally do some "meta
  analysis"&lt;/em&gt;. Scroll back a week or two and see what the past week's
  headlines as an aggragate look like before jumping to the present.
  Appreciate the bias of a newspaper, e.g. you can expect CNN to push
  one sort of narrative, RT to push another, and so on and so forth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the strategies above, I would like to think that I keep my views
more &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that I don't just plug myself into the
Google hivemind and accept the first few results; hopefully these
techniques facilitate exercising &lt;em&gt;critical thinking&lt;/em&gt; in that they
force me to &lt;em&gt;slow down&lt;/em&gt; and take time to digest the various forms of
messaging thrown at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, I'll probably be doing some more reading on
communications, adverising, and that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; do this in seminary&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g. the people listed
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In
protestant land, I don't think I learned much about these people
at all; rather, we focused on theology through secondary,
contemporary sources and the text of the 66-book protestant Bible&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Productivity Strategy: Circuits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-42.html"&gt;previous blog
post&lt;/a&gt;
I briefly discussed how iterating through different "stations" (e.g.
doing a workout routine with various machines, doing a fixed number of
reps on each machine) could be a good strategy to keep a workout
going, allowing parts of your body to rest while maintaining
momentum/intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I've been working on developing this idea further by
bringing this into the abstracted/software/computaitonal world as
well. One could &lt;em&gt;cycle&lt;/em&gt; through different projects; working on one
until you hit some road block, making some notes about how you think
you should pick stuff up next time you start, and then moving on to
the next thing. This way you keep multiple projects going (and hence
get stuff done) and also do not get too held up on the frustrations of
any one product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy not in the "philosophy" genre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have heard stuff about how the ancient greeks/chinese/etc.
studied "philosophy" was different from the rather obscure field it is
today. What we now classify as "ancient philosophy" can be a
combination of practical how-to's, religious revalations, texts on
governing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I think it is important to consider how today's &lt;em&gt;genres&lt;/em&gt; are very
specific things; perhaps if were to take today's collections of text,
we might call things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;self-help books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pop psychology, pop science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;marketing, communications, business writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assorted blogs on the internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...philosophy?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going further back in time, we have less and less knowledge about what
was written vs what survived; the ability to use writing and make
documents that lasted was far less widespread too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Programing Language Study: Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked through the &lt;a href="http://www.rubykoans.com/"&gt;Ruby Koans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of ideas that are common among Nodejs programers may have come
from Ruby; for example the "Agile" movement, Test Driven Development
(TDD), and other ways of organizing programer laber...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching Ruby, I'm trying to make extensive use of both the
interactive interpreter (&lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;) and offline documentation (&lt;code&gt;ri&lt;/code&gt;). The
idea here is that being able to quickly discover new things about a
language as you work in it is a good strategy to be able to continue
moving and learning in a language and not to get hung/up stuck due to
lack of momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Juggling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I started to do some more juggling. I first learned how to
do this during my elementary school years (long ago). Why would I move
away from it and then come back later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I stopped doing juggling and started doing other things
because there were things that were more interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now juggling is once again interesting to me to practice because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want some physical activity that is relatively quiet, can be done
   in small space,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is not so physically exhausting that it can be done for long
   periods of time without respite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is analog (lol, as in... not digital, doesn't need the Internet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically I can do some casual juggling practice as
recreation/sport while listening to music, watching videos, hanging
out with others, etc. Not bad!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 47</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-47.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-09T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-07-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-07-09:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-47.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Faced with scarcity, people naturally plan.

&lt;li&gt;Going on a camping trip with limited food, you'll have to decide
  &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to eat &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing you only get &lt;em&gt;one hour to study&lt;/em&gt; for some exam, you'll want
  to know what the most effective study methods are to extract the
  most out of this hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constrained by a budget (e.g. &lt;em&gt;your own money&lt;/em&gt;), you will aim to get
  the best deals you can; with tooling, you will want to buy quality
  things that you won't have to soon replace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, abundance can lead to great waste in time, energy,
and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simulating Scarcity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schedules and structuring time can be used to make "artificial
scarcity"; you can trick yourself to being more efficient by imposing
scenarios on yourself that necessitate planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you make a plan to eat only one meal per day, you will want to
  plan to eat something that tastes good and is nutritious. You may
  arrange your social life around enjoying this one meal &lt;em&gt;with other
  people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may alot different time blocks for studying different subjects;
  e.g. focus on studying for one exam for an hour, working on another
  project for two, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your budgeting plan may amount to deciding to &lt;em&gt;save&lt;/em&gt; a certain
  portion of the money you bring in on a fixed interval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Degrees of Freedom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, having the flexibility to change/adjust plans to meet new
requirements (or ride &lt;em&gt;waves of inspiration&lt;/em&gt;) is a helpful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What needs to be done is to strike a balance between having enough
structure to keep one motivated/working/productive and enough freedom
to capitalize on unforseen events. Good organization is organization
that makes sense to do, which you don't have to constantly think
about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 46</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-46.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-07T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-07-07T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-07-07:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-46.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, I've been working on learning &lt;strong&gt;DevOps&lt;/strong&gt; things.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevOps&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of practices that combines software development
(Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems
development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high
software quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In plain English, I call DevOps something like "looking into how to
take software that people write and get it where it needs to be to
&lt;em&gt;get work done&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different people do different jobs: e.g. designers design fancy apps,
web programers write code to implement fancy apps, and analysts crunch
numbers to figure out how to make money off those fancy apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOps is smashing all this work together into something that does
work in the real world. It is trying to automate much of the process,
making it easy to &lt;strong&gt;scale&lt;/strong&gt; operations, do fast fixes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Applying Knowledge from Hobbies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to look into this field because I already enjoy doing things
like configuring linux, working with command line tools, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having trouble finding programing/coding projects that
interested me because oftentimes, the software I might want to write
&lt;em&gt;already exists&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;it just needs to be configured and run
somewhere. For example, this blog that you are reading was made using
a &lt;strong&gt;static site generator&lt;/strong&gt;. It could be interesting and educational
to go write my own static site generator, but really this program does
everything I need it to do. I just write text in an easy to read/use
language (markdown) and web pages get generated&amp;mdash;amazing! I can
publish a live journal here, backed up/preserved by our friends at
Github x Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with this site, there are more complicated projects (such as
ones that have &lt;em&gt;interactivity&lt;/em&gt;) one may want to deploy. Dumping a
bunch of HTML pages and images (examples of &lt;strong&gt;static assets&lt;/strong&gt;) on the
Internet is often not hard. How about deploying a program that
interacts with some database? A place to submit a form to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setting stuff up automatically&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of DevOps is writing configuration files (which are &lt;em&gt;declarations
of how stuff should be&lt;/em&gt;). These files get read by programs that run
other programs (that run other programs, that run other programs...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a local level, doing this has been great fun. DevOps sounds like an
in-demand place to do similar things, at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a direction for &lt;em&gt;what to learn more about&lt;/em&gt;, I think that learning
more about the &lt;em&gt;operations&lt;/em&gt; part of DevOps and how to coordinate 
people and teams is a good direction to move into for a future
involving building useful things to help us all live better lives.&lt;/p&gt;

number! Maybe it is better if I &lt;strong&gt;virtue signal&lt;/strong&gt; to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this month, I'm doing an experiment. As much as I can, even
walking around the house, I'm going to leave my phone in my pocket.
We'll see how good Google's location tracking is; will it catch these
relatively small movements (at the same address, but moving around
within that location)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What's in store&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It kinda feels like being in a giant store all the time. When you
visit Target or something, you can expect cameras everywhere watching
to make sure people don't steal merchandise, cause trouble with
employees, etc. Likewise, the store obviously has a goal to sell you
stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, I have no problem with surveillance and cameras and stuff
&lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. However, I think that it is not unreasonable for people to
want private spaces in addition to public spaces. When private spaces
are constantly invaded by activitites like soliciting, marketing, etc.
this is no good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically, each individual can decide what spaces they think should
be private and make rules/policies/schedules to keep it this way.
People may come up with rules like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No politics talk at the dinner table &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No phones out when friends meet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't watch YouTube videos until 8 PM; go to sleep by midnight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially at first, it takes discipline to do these things. Strong
 leadership is needed to bring changes to groups as well&amp;mdash;e.g.
 parents must be able to follow these rules themselves so children can
 see why they are so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you want privacy, use a smartphone as little as possible!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

accessing content which you know at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; other person at least sort of
cares about. This is to ensure that link clicking and stuff isn't a solipsistic
activity. The act of going through other people to click links&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there is &lt;strong&gt;reciprocity&lt;/strong&gt;. Other people will often appreciate it if you
take the time to take a look at stuff that interests them, make comments, etc.
Internet media becomes more social when you ditch search engines when possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Blogging as a resource&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write these blogs to remember &lt;em&gt;processes&lt;/em&gt; I went through; this can include
thinking about issues as well as technical stuff I've figured out...&lt;/p&gt;

computer with limited available applications installed.
This old computer has only 2 GB of RAM, but it is enough for most things that
might be considered a "good use of time" on a computer, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing basic email, logistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I have a kind of hardware-enforced zen computing experience. I'm using a
nice ergonomic keyboard and mouse pairing, I am sitting on the floor, and I
have an old laptop next to me. While I type, I don't even need to look at the
laptop; I can close my eyes, glance over every once in a while, and just let
the text flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Downgrading" equipment to upgrade "experience"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might ask &lt;em&gt;why in the twentieth century&lt;/em&gt; would people ever do things like
shoot film photography, ride a single speed bicycle, or use decade plus old
computer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the fun of this LARPing (live action role-playing) is that more
"modern" solutions often don't offer much new functionality that will actually
get used. News features can lead to more complicated/bloated UIs, and an
overall more &lt;em&gt;unpleasant&lt;/em&gt; experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back to the fundamentals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason people opt for simpler approaches to things is that it offers a
return to the "fundamentals". In order for a bicycle to &lt;em&gt;go&lt;/em&gt; what is needed?
You're going to need some mechanism to turn the wheels; something to be able
to slow down and/or stop... that's about it. If you aren't optimizing to be
the fastest bicyclist ever (vast majority of people), a single speed bicycle
will do just fine. Particularly if you are trying to ride a bicycle to get
more exercise, riding a single speed bicycle might be a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; choice
because you will not be helped along by gearing optimizations and such...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, returning to a computer that has "limited" features in many
ways is a good opportunity to bring thinking back to myself and to quit
fussing over piles and piles of software abstraction. At the end of the day,
if I just want to practice writing some code, author some prose, etc., the
stripped-down system I have now is much more efficient (i.e. "non-bloated").&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 42</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-42.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-29T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-29T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-06-29:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-42.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post I'm going to talk about why I usually don't suggest

&lt;em&gt;studying more than one foreign language at once&lt;/em&gt; to people. Mainly,
this is because learning a new language will involve you to train
&lt;em&gt;thinking in a new model&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. language); anyone who is proficient in
a second language will tell you that &lt;em&gt;they do not translate in their
heads&lt;/em&gt;; rather, they know how to reproduce the correct patterns and
see the world in terms of a particular model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More practical tips can be found on my &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/learning.html"&gt;language
learning&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Cost of Decision Making&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you are studying two languages: Esperanto and Klingon. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any point in the day, you might want to practice making up some
utterances in your &lt;strong&gt;target&lt;/strong&gt; language. A decision point comes up!
Which language should I practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You then proceed to waste time and energy dabbling between your two
languages, not getting anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A solution: Organized Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best solution I've found to the above problem is to divide up what
things you're going to practice into different "modes" or "contexts".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you might &lt;em&gt;only use Esperanto&lt;/em&gt; on your desktop computer
using the Firefox browser. You can change this browser's default
language, bookmark a handful of sites, etc. Once you are proficient
enough, you can also get some friends to agree to only use Esperanto
in a group chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a kind of "spatial" separation. But you can divide by time as well.
Suppose all of your Esperanto-studying friends are up, awake, and
chatty around 4-8 PM PST. Well, you can say that during the hours of
4-8 PM, you try your best to think, read, write, etc. using Esperanto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Organization Allows You to Outsource Decision Making&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good organization means you take care of decision making &lt;em&gt;ahead of
time&lt;/em&gt;. That way, you don't waste time dilly-dallying around and you
can focus on your primary task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividing up your time to avoid decision making means less getting
bored and more easily foreseeable "endpoints" for painful tasks. It
likewise means you get to look forward to new activities throughout
the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Working Out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working out with some friends, we set up a number of "stations". Lift
weights here, do some cardio there, etc. You do a couple minutes at
each station, then you rotate. This way, you can keep exercising (and
hence keep heart rate up) while working out a lot of different
muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is similar to what is being described above, but it is
set on an accelerated schedule (time frame of minutes instead of hours
of organization).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Practicing Art, Music, etc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would I do if I wanted to become a much better visual artist?
There are a number of activities I could do, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realistic still life drawing: practicing observing reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical know/how tooling: e.g. shortcut keys on my digital setup,
  making particular effects with a (physical) graphite pencil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theory/reading: studying writings of accomplished artists; watching
  YouTube training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To become better at art, I would do this. Before work, from 8:30-8:50
AM, make a still life drawing on anything&amp;mdash;no inspiration is
needed, I just have to pick something in my immediate environment.
Then I can concentrate on one thing inspired by the previous day's
study&amp;mdash;e.g. concentrate on using relatively few, but well-defined
lines of varying thickness to convey form. I would then do my day job
(9 AM &amp;ndash; 5 PM). From 5-6 PM I could then go look up some training
materials, try out some new buttons, etc. Here I might be working on
my "main" platform (e.g. digital painting, 3D software, oil painting,
etc.) rather than the morning sketching which is mostly done for
convenience without a "full setup". I could then go do some other
stuff. From around 8 PM to 9:30 PM I could work on whatever (big)
project(s) I have. Then from 9:30 PM to 9:45 PM I could read some
theory to think about before falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying a similar approach to any other activity that is a learned
skill will allow you to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

looking at things answers questions like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is it so difficult to define words like "a", "to", "the", etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do advertisers/politicians/etc. use "trigger words" to manage your
  feelings (and wallets)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are skills related to each other? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is it hard to learn the rules of cricket?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things and Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard it said that if you learn &lt;em&gt;any one programing language&lt;/em&gt;,
it will be much easier to pick up a second/third/fourth/etc. Allow me spell out
in more plain terms &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; this is so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using any "general purpose" programing language, there are basic operations you
may want to do. For example, you might want to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read/write files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deal with clocks/time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate text/strings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve or request web content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person without any programing background may have some fuzzy ideas of what
these operations are, but likely understands them only in some limited context.
E.g. a file is something you can attach in Gmail, which is found somewhere on a
harddrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning programing means that you have to get more specific understanding of
what is involved in these operations. Learning some ("general purpose")
language for the first time means you will have to learn about these things.
Some examples of these languages are: Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript (with Node),
and.... Common Lisp. All of these languages can do these basic things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who already programs in one language, learning a new programing
language is often asking "how do I do &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; XYZ in &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; ABC. It is
easy to compose a search query if you know exactly what you're looking for.
You have a base knowledge of concepts (you understand computing as a &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt;)
and then you can learn the unique features and idiosyncracies of any languages
you use; you are not-relearning an entire new system with every new programing
language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keywords and Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many symbols (e.g. &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; in spoken and written language) can only be
understood in the context of a system.  This is one reason why it is very hard
to usefully define "grammatical" words like prepositions, articles, and the
like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding any complex system means knowing how stuff "fits together".
Often times, this knowledge comes through exposure and without explanation.
Copying enough patterns, one can assimilate knowledge of these patterns and
successfully replicate them, sometimes with intentional variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many musicians know very little "music theory" but get along just fine having a
great time with their instruments and voices. Asked to define something like
"harmonics" or whatever, many skilled musicians would be at a loss of
&lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;they could &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt; you lots of things, but they couldn't say much
useful stuff explaining what they're doing in a different system (e.g. Standard
English) unless they already had some experience thinking about
teaching/learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems have atomic (in the sense of "indivisible") things in terms of which
other things are described. Eager beginners may want to hear explanations of
what these elementary things are (e.g. How do &lt;em&gt;particles&lt;/em&gt; in Japanese work?!). 
They will likely be frustrated by the responses they get back; even with ample
explanation, they may not be able to correctly reproduce target patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the person that just learns a guitar strum pattern rather than going
into fancy rhythm this and that theory may soon be playing songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assimilating knowledge of a system (and then refining that model) is ultimately
how learning of complex things happen. Trying to go very deep into
understanding little pieces &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; work eventually, but from my experience I
think that it usually doesn't. Imagine getting hung up on studying a foreign
language until you "understand" how some little grammatical word works. The
practical way forward is just to learn a whole bunch of (easy to "understand")
vocabularly and then gradually see patterns in which stuff is put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Likeness Between Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insofar as systems are simialr to one another, it is not difficult to learn and
master new systems. For example, I hear the mechanics of good golf swings are
similar to hockey stick swings. Transferring concepts between these systems
means a golfer will probably more quickly learn hockey stick swinging technique
than say... a jazz pianist, all other things being equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, learning a completely new skill (e.g. computer programing)
can be very tough because you have to assimilate a whole body of conceptual
knowledge before being able to properly order some symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Simplified Systems and Manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People use technical-sounding language to drivel on about topics all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in health/nutrition related topics, you might get someone talking
about sodium this-or-that. In what sense do they mean "sodium"? Without a more
complete understanding of chemistry/biology fundamentals, this person is trying
to use a technical sounding term &lt;em&gt;outside of its domain&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, doing stuff like this is often enough to win the confidence/trust of people.
If someone looks good/fit, and they mouth off utter bullshit in terms of
words/symbols, they may be accepted on &lt;em&gt;authority&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds smart and seems to work, so we can roll with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shallow knowledge, words getting thrown around without model comprehension...
this is how powerful people manipulate fearful masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case Study: Condescending IT worker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Condescending IT worker may lord his esoteric computer knowledge over
customer service/marketing/etc. This person may throw around random technical
words that he &lt;em&gt;assumes&lt;/em&gt; the people he is talking to don't really understand to
assert his position of being "the technical one".o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, it is easy. We just need to migrate the ABC to the XYZ using
such-and-such fancy shmancy technology. Lol! Automation is cool. Do u
automate things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the non-IT people the symbols this Condescending IT worker is using have
only one meaning&amp;mdash;"I am going to use &lt;em&gt;a system you don't understand&lt;/em&gt; to do
&lt;em&gt;a thing you are at my mercy for&lt;/em&gt;". It is a nerd display of dominance, not an
attempt to get othe rpeople to understand the technical workings of some
system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case Study: Esoteric interest "geek"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another character you may have met is someone who is always into &lt;em&gt;stuff other
than what is mainstream&lt;/em&gt;; insufferable hipsters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than succeeding in some realm with well-defined systems (e.g. a
profession, mathematics, speaking a foreign language), they instead turn to
maximally esoteric things to &lt;em&gt;compete with nobody&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;assert their authority
on something unknown to you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing about music lady that doesn't ever play piano or guitar, but instead
makes some sounds on such-and-such ethnic instrument from a culture that is not
her own. Or consider art guy who &lt;em&gt;never does realistic art&lt;/em&gt; and instead rambles
on about such-and-such theory of this-and-that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people get knowledge of some esoteric systems and then try to assert
control over you (often subtly) by lording their specialist knowledge over you
(and other "normal people" in society).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Case Study: Institutional Talking Heads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I introduced two sorts of "loser"ish characters here to lead gently into
discussing the more threatening force&amp;mdash;institutionally approved talking
heads and the authority of the state, big tech, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people use the same tactics, albeit more skillfully, than the
aforementioned characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I've many times repeated the point that &lt;em&gt;with regards to
COVID-19, we just don't know what's going on&lt;/em&gt;.  Yet, tons and tons of people
rose to the occasion to tell everybody else what to do based on such and such
"science" or counts of who-knows-what gathered in who-knows-how way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's lots and lots of conversation of the form,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know what is going on. Here's a WORD to latch onto. Now, do what we say
and oppose who we tell you is the bad guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on tactics later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 40</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-40.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-06-24:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-40.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to ramble about "science" versus business books, pop

understanding presume a process/establishment that is good enough at
filtering good from no-good to consider humans collectively to be
"moving forward".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next level of thinking about "science" is to consider how
authorities canonize what is(n't) "science" and how knowledge
accumulation is more about finding useful models for different things
and trying to fit them to phenomena. "Science" is a far less unified
thing than people make it out to be. Reporting "facts" is a very
difficult thing to do because "scientific facts" are always with
respect to a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two places to learn more about these things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an introduction, see Luke's Smith &lt;a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/notrelated/S02E01_-_Against_Method_and_For_Pseudoscience.ogg"&gt;Against Method and For
  'Pseudoscience'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a more long-form thing, see the works of &lt;a href="https://fooledbyrandomness.com/"&gt;Nassim Nicholas
  Taleb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some neckbeard might say something like "&lt;em&gt;Qi&lt;/em&gt; energy is not real".
What do they mean by this? That some traditional Chinese school of
thought is completely incoherent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This neckbeard might reply that &lt;em&gt;Qi&lt;/em&gt; cannot be &lt;em&gt;measured&lt;/em&gt; with any
instrument we have. We can't observe &lt;em&gt;Qi&lt;/em&gt; like we measure the
temperature with a thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a difficult person, you create a dataset rating video clips on
the amounts of &lt;em&gt;Qi&lt;/em&gt; energy being displayed. Professional fighters
display lots of &lt;em&gt;Qi&lt;/em&gt; concentration; you mark some high number. Someone
just sitting and not doing much has resting &lt;em&gt;Qi&lt;/em&gt; not doing much. You
tag a few thousand video clips and then run your classification
algorithm on some new data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Machine learning shows &lt;em&gt;Qi&lt;/em&gt; exists?!??!??!?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's lots of useful information all over. Oftentimes, to understand
some isolated "fact" however, you need to understand some more
comprehensive system. Someone who is not trained in biology, 
chemistry, and other things is probably just driveling nonsense if
they are talking about how sodium is good/bad for the body. "Sodium"
is just a magic word to this person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some people talking in terms of martial arts,
traditional medicine, etc. may be onto something. Do they have a model
of the world that helps them do whatever activities they are trying to
do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A programer may be annoyed by many aspects of music notation. Why does
such-and-such have to be so confusing? We must respect the fact that
&lt;em&gt;Western music notation works&lt;/em&gt;, as do programing languages. Both have
lots of room for improvement but they succeed at least somewhat in
some particular domain and we can state "facts" in terms of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, as with the machine learning example above, we can talk
about the models of psychology/business/etc. as put forth in
popular/contemporary readings. Insofar as these books are able to help
people do a better job communicating with others, getting organized,
etc., these works shouldn't just be considered as "pseudoscience".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Fact Checking"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Facts" only make sense with respect to some model of the world. Can
you say that XYZ &lt;em&gt;discovered the atom&lt;/em&gt;? The notion of "atom" as
discussed in physics and stuff today is a very specific thing that
only exists with respect to a particular model of the world. Likewise,
when religious people speak of "the soul", a Christian might mean a
very different thing from a Buddhist or some kind of Pagan. Each
describes this term with respect to some model of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fact checking" is prone to be super annoying and misleading because
it presumes one (establishment-approved) view of the world and calls
things factual or not relative to that.&lt;/p&gt;

Taking some time away from work and normal scheduling can be a very
productive thing, I think. It's good to step back from stuff,
re-evaluate priorities, etc. from time to time. In the future, I'll
make it more of a point to do this intentionally and regularly. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nerd thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I've been reminded of a lot about over the past few years
especially is that it is important to "hang out" and loiter sometimes.
This is related to the topic of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdRJMuOFO88"&gt;not being a
&lt;strong&gt;bugman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a &lt;em&gt;good use of time?&lt;/em&gt; Nerds jump to &lt;strong&gt;optimize&lt;/strong&gt; something,
and in doing so often miss "the big picture". For example, one could
go to school and focus almost solely on getting good grades. In some
parts of my life I have done this&amp;mdash;luckily I was distracted
enough to have fun drawing some pictures and making some friends in
grade school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By blocking out social interactions and focusing on just a few things
(like studying for an exam), one can potentially work much more
efficiently. This is why I think it is OK to do this a lot of the
time. However, doing this &lt;em&gt;all of the time&lt;/em&gt; is no good because what
could end up happening is that one squanders their time on stupid
goals OR misses out on valuable opportunities elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kinda Succeeding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the aforementioned behavior is kind of "built into the program".
For example, growing up and going to church, I found myself focused on
doctrine and "what the Bible says". This is a quite
Protestant/Evangelical Christianity feature, I think. Many other
people who call themselves Christians do not emphasize this aspect of
"practicing religion" so much. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one sense, I succeeded by learning a bunch of Bible knowledge and
stuff. However, in another sense, I totally "lost"; if I look at
people I know who did a better job focusing on people/community rather
than being a nerd, they are the ones that are happily married with
families, community, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way I tried to optimize stuff was using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spaced Repetition
Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (SRS) for
language larning for a while. The problem I faced was that I would not
accompany this SRS learning with enough other (more important)
learning&amp;mdash;e.g. absorbing media of my target languages. On top of
this, I was studying way too many langauges at once. My
over-optimization led me to be able to recognize a whole bunch of
words in a whole bunch of languages but I was not well-practiced in
stringing together sentences, telling jokes, singing songs, and so on
in these languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times it is through networks that people get opportunities, not
being the best at some narrow domain. Those with nerd tendencies (like
myself) often jump to optimizing &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. Combined with Bugman
tendencies, one can easily squander lots and lots of time developing
weird abilities and habits in all sorts of directions. This might be
appropriate sometimes (e.g. a kid exploring various interests), but it
is often not a good approach for getting things done in the "real world".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LARPing as a Slav in the woods with Filipinos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going camping, it was fun to try stuff I normally wouldn't do. For
starters, I don't like to deal with too much stuff when camping. I
helped move all sorts of stuff, including boxing gloves and coolers
filled with meat for fancy cooking. I got to throw a hatchet 😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other small things such as listening to other people's
music choices&amp;mdash;a lot of the fun of music is social&amp;mdash;we want
to enjoy music with other people eventually (this is why there are
things like concerts and dance parties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing Better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanging out with people and socializing is an important thing for
nerds to do. While one may be rather self-content on a day to day
schedule being a nerd, failure to "sync up" with society from time to
time means running the risk of becoming very "out of touch".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond oneself, I think it is important to engage different people
generally&amp;mdash;whether in age/generation, nationality, etc. Only
talking with people of a particular group (e.g. a gamer who only talks
with gamers) can lead to a very warped perception of the world and
many missed opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrogance of the nerd is thinking that they know better than
mainstream society because they do better in some limited domain.
This tendency should be tempered by humbling hang outs with other
elements of society.&lt;/p&gt;

quote marks I'm emphasizing a &lt;em&gt;term/symbol&lt;/em&gt; and how that thing is
used. When two different people use some word (e.g. "believe),
they may mean very different things. I try to mark which terms can
be problematic when doing cross-cultural talk by putting quotes
around stuff and elaborating if people coming from different traditions
(but still "speaking English") may be confused. This is living in
diversity and not having an assumed culture of my readership!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's going on with COVID-19?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matter most are: &lt;em&gt;are there shortages of hospital
facilities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What's going on with COVID-19?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to Coronavirus stuff, I think that the numbers that
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matter most are: &lt;em&gt;are there shortages of hospital
facilities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important, practical way to look at things because it is
saying &lt;em&gt;are we seeing worse effects&lt;/em&gt; (from the flu and other things)
compared with other years? COVID-19 specifically is a mystery, but
whether or not hospitals are totally overrun is something that is
easier to see. Insofar as hospitals &lt;em&gt;are not&lt;/em&gt; totally overrun, I think
that we have room for optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counts of COVID-19 cases and stuff are not so informative because the
way we've been getting these counts are far from uniform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Society Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, we still see lots of people around doing stuff like writing "THE
PANDEMIC ISN'T OVER" in chalk. In stores, perhaps &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people are
wearing some kind of mask thing of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see, there hasn't been a mass return to physical
office spaces though it looks like some people near me are starting to
plan on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Predictions on the Post-COVID-19 World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I see us drifting towards is a cyberpunk-ish (dystopia) like world. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
COVID-19 has revealed how fragile much of American society
is&amp;mdash;people living paycheck to paycheck. Many people have few
people to turn to for emotional/financial/etc support; maybe physical
workplaces provided &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of this (e.g. through seeing co-workers,
that was enough human interaction to keep going). It seems to me that
most people in most places seem to have general dissatisfaction with
what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Populism&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;democracy&lt;/strong&gt; (in the sense of voting for stuff to
affect policy; whether directly or through representatives) are two
forces we can expect to see a lot more of. Urban people in particular
can be expected to try to &lt;em&gt;vote away problems&lt;/em&gt;. I do expect to see
more chaos/civil unrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might this be quelled? One avenue I can see this happening is that
mega-corporations and government may be able to provide &lt;strong&gt;basic
needs&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. food, basic hygiene, housing) in urban areas. Digital
IDs (such as Google accounts) rather than permanent addresses may be
how these things are tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this lock down business has been very tough on small
businesses. Many mega-corporations are doing quite well overall it
seems, as reflected in measures like stock prices. In this way, we can
expect to see large-scale problems continue to pop up &lt;em&gt;that only very
large businesses can deal with&lt;/em&gt;. Big companies can do the heavy
lifting of logistics, and populist politics and democracy can force
them to give basic needs to people. Insofar as people are dependent on
these big companies (and government policies that make it so they must
provide certain things), the elimination of the worse sort of poverty
can be avoided and society can continue. These large
companies&amp;mdash;with government money injections&amp;mdash;willl be able
to provide many jobs to occupy people's time. Some examples include:
stocking shelves, customer support, maintenance of facilities, and
security services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban areas will be places of mass consumption (through a handful of
big companies), near-total surveillance (facillitated by smartphones),
and constant nagging through ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Characters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be some "Buddha" types that live on the benefits of these
systems, but really don't care about all the hype and stuff being
generated to keep the populist machine going. This person may log in
to their XYZ accounts as required at work, get a paycheck from a
megacorporation, and then spend very little of it to get necessities
and route the rest to some practical needs (e.g. investing for a home
elsewhere). They patiently await breaking the cycle of suffering, and
in the mean time cultivate mindsets that allow them to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be "community organizer"/"activist" types who take to this
sort of environment like fish and water. The useful propaganda
officers of the government and mega-corporation alliance, these people
will provide the "grassroots" feelings to people on the ground, motivating 
normally non-political people to repeat the correct slogans and
present the correct branding to signal their allegiance. Note that,
gov'ts and megacorporations may make use of &lt;strong&gt;controlled
opposition&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;similar to how when two sports teams play against
each other, the NBA (or whatever-organization-oversees them) "wins" no
matter which team wins the ball game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will always be politicians. The appeal of being a politician
will increase with respect to how powerful/invasive the state is into
people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be masses of normal people who just go along with the
current times, trying to get by while enjoying some material comforts
along the way. The people will be most of us, and they will be like
water, flowing and adjusting with the times. Unlike the "Buddha"
character, they will not think about transcending/breaking from this
cycle at all. Rather, they will be medium by which various parties try
to execute their agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff like "Dystopia" vs "Utopia" may be a matter of
perspective. Echoing some thoughts brought up earlier&amp;mdash;one
might say the same thing about heaven/hell. If being near God
means badness for you, that may be "hell". If it means good
things, it could be "heaven". I'll have to look more into how this
sort of... unitary/subjective (not quite sure how to characterize
it) view has been expressed.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

looking at language learning materials for the purposes of reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wanting nice stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly I was wanting an e-ink display; it seems that some cool new
things are being developed such as,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boox.com/product-2/"&gt;BOOX Ebook Reader/Notetaker Products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dasung-Paperlike-Front-Light-Touch-Monitor/dp/B07SKS6CS7/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=e-ink+display&amp;amp;qid=1591973925&amp;amp;sr=8-5"&gt;Dasung E-Ink Display 13.3"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than being a hero for the economy and immediately buying stuff,
I decided to turn my attention to many of the things I already have
and see how I could make better of these things rather than seeking
new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was done while shuffling some displays/peripherals/etc.; a
similar spirit to fussing with (physical) config to make things nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advantages of paper for language learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a bunch of reference materials for language learning in paper
format. Do check out my various pages on
&lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/languages/index.html"&gt;languages&lt;/a&gt; if you haven't done so already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Typesetting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, paper publications will contain fancy typesetting that is
helpful for learning purposes and not usually present on resources
like websites. For beginner to intermediate learners especially these
things are helpful to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Japanese, paper publications aimed at learners (e.g. children,
weebs) will often contain &lt;i&gt;furigana&lt;/i&gt;, pronunciation marks over
words. Now, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; automate a similar function pretty well using
browser extensions or with the aid of a pop-up dictionary (like
&lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichamp/"&gt;Rikaichamp&lt;/a&gt;
for Firefox). However, sometimes these tools can give ambiguous or
incorrect results&amp;mdash;nothing beats manual annotation (it is like
having an authoritative native speaker by your side).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar things exist in other languages. For instance in Russian,
texts for learners often label &lt;strong&gt;accent&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. accented &lt;em&gt;Ру́сский
язы́к&lt;/em&gt; "Russian language" vs the normal orthography &lt;em&gt;Русский язык&lt;/em&gt;).
Arabic only marks long vowels usually; short vowel markings will
annotate texts for learners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having these annotations readily available in learning means you can
spend more time language learning and less time fussing with tooling.
By having resources available to conveniently learning things
correctly &lt;em&gt;the first time&lt;/em&gt; as you are exposed, you can save time in
the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multi-booking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the aforementioned advantages can also be found in PDF books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, nothing beats having a bunch of paper books open &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your
computer and other stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books are like... little high quality ink displays. You can have a
bunch of "displays" set up&amp;mdash;a dictionary, a grammar reference,
and some text you are trying to work through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well", someone might say, "one advantage of using a computer/PDFs is
having &lt;em&gt;your entire library on demand&lt;/em&gt;". Sometimes, this is good. But
often for intense study I find I don't really need or make use of this
advantage. At any given time, how many hours are you going to spend over &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;
books? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper books mean setting things up to see all the info you need right
at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Portability/Robustness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heading is relatively self-explanatory. Books don't need
batteries. You can ad-hoc upgrade them with annotations, book covers,
and more. Books are often not so expensive to replace if stuff goes
bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of digital materials are readily understandable for
people that make daily use of them. Particularly nice are things like
search functionality, indexing, and other features that require manual
lookup in paper books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One question to ask is &lt;em&gt;where is the bottleneck of my learning?&lt;/em&gt; I've
found that just contemplating some key term &lt;em&gt;while fumbling through an
index&lt;/em&gt; has in fact been helpful for helping me remember concepts.
Thumbing through a dictionary has helped me discover things about
languages I would not have otherwise seen if I had enjoyed near
instantaneous results.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 35</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-35.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-10T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-06-10:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-35.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I continue off yesterday's notes on &lt;em&gt;In the Buddha's Words: An

&lt;p&gt;It seems in Buddhism, suffering in the world is not totally chaotic or
random. This can be interpreted in a very "anti-social justice" sense
in that when we see bad things happen to people, there is an
underlying belief that &lt;em&gt;their karma made them deserve this&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Buddhist will want to escape suffering (and probably help
others do the same, cultivating &lt;em&gt;loving-kindness&lt;/em&gt;). But viewing
suffering in the world is also seeing the &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; of suffering
perpetuating behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical Christian world-view on these things is much different.
Similarly, Christians don't believe in repeating cycles of death and
rebirth. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I had this book on the shelf for a while and was interested in reading
something a bit more ancient the 20th century stuff and contemporary
things I've been reading lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the best of my knowledge, I don't have any Buddhism stuff in my
direct line of descent, though it is such an old way of doing things,
I would be surprised if there wasn't any going back into my Chinese
ancestry. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Mainly, I'm looking into these things out of
curiosity and for knowledge&amp;mdash;I'm not trying to "convert" or
anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of my impressions&amp;mdash;a practicing Buddhist may want
to reach out to me and correct my misunderstandings here. What follows
is an outsider's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tiers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing interesting about Buddhism compared with the Christianity I
know is that Buddhism is a very much "choose your own adventure" type
of religion. Practitioners of Buddhism may be lay people that try to
suffer and aquire good &lt;em&gt;kamma&lt;/em&gt; (Sanskrit: Karma) by following "best
practices", &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; they can live life in super hard mode and strive for
"release" from the sufferings of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many recommendations for lay people reminded me of Confucian
ideas&amp;mdash;defining proper relations between different sorts of
people (e.g. Children and Parents, Husbands and Wives). This is on one
hand unsurprising, but also has got me thinking about &lt;em&gt;how Buddhism
became very popular in China&lt;/em&gt; during various times/places in Chinese
history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doing nothing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with Christianity, it seems that Buddhism supports a lot
of... inaction. In Christiandom, the &lt;em&gt;Protestant work ethic&lt;/em&gt; is
(in)famous&amp;mdash;industriousness is valued not only for the products
of work in of itself but also as a means for fighting against
temptation and sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Buddhism has &lt;em&gt;meditation&lt;/em&gt; as a central practice. Poverty,
homelessness, and being at the charity of others are required for
pursuing Buddha-dom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than having an integration of serious religious practitioners
and "normal" working/daily life, Buddhism divides "serious"
practitioners from lay practioners, and the &lt;em&gt;professionals&lt;/em&gt; are
devoted full-time to practices which do not directly contribute &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;
to society (e.g. by producing food).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Starting from the self&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems lots of stuff in Buddhism you are supposed to do because &lt;em&gt;it
makes sense to do in order to reduce suffering&lt;/em&gt;. There is a kind of
empirical, internal justification that I think has appealed to many
Westerners. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; From a Christian perspective, this may make a lot of
Buddhism seem rather... &lt;strong&gt;amoral&lt;/strong&gt; (c.f. &lt;em&gt;(im)moral&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More later&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come as I study more; these are some quick initial thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never had any contact with relatives &lt;em&gt;in China&lt;/em&gt; to the best of
my knowledge; seems I am many generations back Chinese-American
(3+). Before widespread literacy and such it is harder to trace
back further than that.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting into Buddhism has a long history in the West it seems;
may have to look more into stories of this&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I would say that the Harry Potter series is very
&lt;em&gt;entertaining&lt;/em&gt;. There are likeable characters and the books are very
readable. You could call them "page turners".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not they reveal valuable information about the nature of
the universe or human interactions, that is a different question. For
the millennial generation, they are definitely culturally significant,
but I am not sure if they will be for subsequent generations.&lt;/p&gt;

reading the books, though I would if there were some social reasons

(in)famous for previously teaching techniques as a "Pick Up Artist"
but has henceforth continued his authoring and podcasting journey as a
Christian. For his ability to do long streams, engage a diverse

find something interesting as well. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall the first time I looked more than trivially at anything
Orthodox Christianity related&amp;mdash;it was looking at
Evangelical/Protestant (the brand of Christianity I was familiar with)
versus Orthodox conceptions of the afterlife. For many Christians
(especially American Christians), these issues are of very big
significance; learning more about the history of Christianity you may
be surprised how many different views on such matters they exist and
how the "heaven/hell" as a literal place of bliss/suffering as
portrayed in popular media are rather particular concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What appeals to me about (non-Evangelical) Christianity is that there
seems to be less preocuppation with the "literal meaning of words" and
pronouncements of certain doctrines. In Internet slang, one might call
many Protestant brands "autistic" in that they fixate on issues like
DO YOU ACCEPT STATEMENTS X, Y, and Z NECESSARY FOR SALVATION?
Likewise, you will have people splitting hairs over issues like the
age of teh earth. As I understand them, most other religions teach a
more wholistic lifestyle approach; it is not about suddenly
"believing" certain things or revalation so much as it is about
following some path...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not personally close to anybody of Orthodox faith; it would be
curious to talk to some people at length, after I do some homework.
My understanding of religion is very colored by the particular sort of
Christianity I grew up with and the limited reading/study I have done
outside of this tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming days I will likely be doing more reading and research
into Christian matters, documenting stuff here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do check out Roosh's work, I would say just go straight
to his website, &lt;a href="https://www.rooshv.com/"&gt;rooshv.com&lt;/a&gt; and skip
meta commentary about who he is and stuff from anonymous people on
the Internet, journalists, etc. Then make your own evaluation and
validate if needed&amp;dmash; in general I think this is a decent
approach to engage new authors. Note that I &lt;em&gt;am reading Harry
Potter currently&lt;/em&gt; (there is a meme going around that this is
"liberal theory") so this isn't just about listening to "fringe"
YouTubers or whatever; it is a methodology for giving all sorts of
voices a fair hearing.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

again, Luke &lt;em&gt;Senpai&lt;/em&gt; was a year or so ahead of my investigations into
various issues related to linguistics, history of science, and the
like etc. It is very nice to see some ideas I just started fumbling
around with presented in a such an accessible way to a wide audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of publishing some more autobiographical/narrative
stuff here, but had misgivings midway through writing and ended up
deleting what I had written. Maybe I'll think over and write some
stuff on these topics I was thinking of later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the Internet has gotten more convenient and nice. For
instance, we have more than a dozen chat services to choose from to
exchange text messages, photos, etc. With this, however, the Internet
also feels much more corporate. It seems less fun, less free, and &lt;em&gt;far
more political&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and so, writing this blog I wonder; what is the point of me trying
to just shoot-the-shit here? It may de-favor me in search engines and
stuff if I would like my work to get more popular. Furthermore, anything
remotely controversial I may write could be used against me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, being "a nobody" is helpful in that there is nothing dramatic
happening/going on with my blog. It is just an open journal that I find
useful to write in because it helps me look from a third person
perspective on the stuff I think and say and see if it makes any sense
(and if it is worth sharing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we're getting into the night, I'm too tired to do any "serious
studying" or reading now... I'll probably go to sleep soon. The agenda
of this journal is to think out loud, to figure out what is going on.
It is Friday night in Sacramento, CA and I'm not really talking to
anybody right now. There is a curfew outside, so I can't go for a
literal walk outside. So, I go for a little metaphorical walk writing
stuff here... turning sentence-thoughts into prose from a standing
work station made of furniture and books and old computer parts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 29</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-29.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-06-04T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-06-04:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-29.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last post I discussed some ways to do "digital

prepping"&amp;mdash;basically getting your computers/devices to be useful
to you even when you are offline. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Being prepared to move and work
in different environments is a way to transcend being locked into any
one particular arrangement that can compromise things that are
important to you. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If you found yourself working for a large
corporation in a big city with very high living costs&amp;mdash;you may
become a very unfree person if you have savings and other preparations
ready so that you can relocate at will. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; With shifting political
tides, dramatic economic ups and downs, etc. what guarantees do you
expect in such an environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the most invaluable specialist (e.g. expertise maintaining
some essential system running some arcane technology; being a licensed
professional in a high-demand area), becoming overly embedded in a
system of which you exert little control is a dangerous gamble of
indentured servitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Property ownership and building stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, once you own property or have a network established
in area, you have an interested to sink your roots maximally deep
there. It becomes more efficient to settle and develop oneself in some
area and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be concerned with the many costs of moving around and
dealing with urban politics/logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one reason why the internment of Japanese people (including US
citizens) in the US was a big deal; particularly for agriculturally
minded people, being settled in a "homeland" is important for building
up lots of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise while we see many different groups interested in
defending their homelands, whether this is ethnic neighborhoods or
religious freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nomadic, Diaspora Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that this sort of thinking I opened this post with is
characteristic of someone without a relatively fixed community or home
base to build up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; having land (or a family) to build stuff on encourages an
itinerate lifestyle and non-committal attitudes towards the well-being
of "the commons"&amp;mdash;you can see this for yourself by visiting
university dorms at least midway through an academic term. Students
are paying high prices to stay at these dorms, but are expected on
being kicked out in a timely basis and charged for whatever damages
management can find. Students likewise can expect to extract
themselves from any bad living arrangements within the terms of their
lease. So if there are hostilities with other people in dorm/apartment
complexes it can be more time efficient to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; solve problems since
there is little "long run" to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reciprocity and Asymmetrical Arrangements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expecting reciprocity (a "symmetrical" arrangement) is a feature of a
high-trust society. If you treat others well, do you expect them to
likewise treat you well? Relatively trusting, kind natured people will
expect that their concessions, symbolic deference (e.g. &lt;em&gt;kowtow&lt;/em&gt;ing)
and other actions inviting reconciliation will make things better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is conditional on the other parties involved. For example, a
tenant and a landlord may very well be incentivized to work out some
dispute about a payment because the landlord has other things to
attend to and would prefer to not go through the trouble of eviction
and likewise a tenant would rather not accrue legal costs and other
badness in addition to whatever issues they are facing. On the other
hand, we would call it
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Simp"&gt;simping&lt;/a&gt; if a
man contunally tried to win a woman's favor with repeated
non-reciprocation of affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking around the neighborhood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking down the street, I see written in chalk in front of someone's
house,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE PANDEMIC IS NOT OVER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...I see tons of rainbow flags (probably more than US flags), and many
BLM sympathetic signs of various sorts. And I perceive hostility in
all directions&amp;mdash;people bunkering down in their houses repeating
slogans and symbols fed to them by the media. What do you want me to
think? That I am in a tolerant neighborhood surrounded by a bunch of
good folks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet most of u are pretty okay to hang out with most of the time;
but I think you'd be better off just shutting off the news and being
concerned with taking care of the things right in from you (e.g.
caring for interpersonal relationships with the people in your
households; doing some exercises...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel more connection with the fellow jogger near me who has to cross
to the other side of the street to avoid an out of control barking dog
than I do with these media slogan repeaters. Working from home?! Laid
off from your job? It is invigorating to see people using this
opportunity to make things better for themselves and by extension
those they maintain contact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My unsolicited advice to many people would be to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study and analyze the news as propaganda (you can even agree with
many of the messages) or shut it off. Don't passively absorb it or
you will be miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm not about to give unsolicited advice to strangers in the
middle of a race war which some are trying to escalate into a Marxist
class struggle involving everyone, everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, being on the academic job market may mean that you

political messaging featured front and center. I retreat to my ivory
tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is a time to study, to work, to write... ...to pray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I didn't post my blog to social media. Today, I don't think
I will post my blog to social media either. I think there are lots
more useful things to read than my blog for other people&amp;mdash;I'll
keep on writing this here because I think it is useful for me to do,
but I don't feel an urge to push it out into "the public space" as
at this time our public spaces are thoroughly advertisement infested
with charismatic campaigns I can't hope to compete with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Civilizations need libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I'll complain about technology, but at the end of the day,
I'm not anti-technology. I'm thankful for many of the nice things we
have that make lots of tasks easier. The trick is to make technology
&lt;em&gt;work for you&lt;/em&gt;, not the other way around. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disconnect: a heuristic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One easy way to make sure technology is being useful to you (a tool to
allow you to do stuff more efficiently) is to disconnect as much of it
as you can from places where announcements/advertisements are pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truely, for most software, we don't need the "latest and greatest"
software&amp;mdash;stuff written 10 years or more ago can often do the
trick. For example you might have applications to do the following,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write documents (e.g. Libreoffice Writer, markdown, LaTeX)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculator/number crunching (e.g. spreadsheets, R for statistics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Media player (e.g. mpv, VLC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pdf reader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programing languages and tools; editors, interpreters, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, I listed mostly open source or free software things because
these can be downloaded and used without forced updates. Getting some
mainstream Linux distribution&amp;mdash;such as Ubuntu&amp;mdash;will give you
most of these things readily. For more specialized tasks, you may have
to go download stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacOS does a decent job giving you alot of useful things right out of
the box (as well as some extra specialty things, like Garage Band for
music making).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an adequate pile of software such that &lt;em&gt;your computer/laptop
will still be useful to you while offline&lt;/em&gt; is an effective heuristic
to make sure your technology is yours to command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Going on the Internet sometimes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above things prepared, you can go online and grab a bunch of
stuff to enjoy/study/etc. offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't use Spotify or similar streaming services (though I often play
music on YouTube). I think that
&lt;a href="https://youtube-dl.org/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;youtube-dl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a helpful tool for
downloading media to (re)play later for as well as for archiving
purposes. Many old books and other documents are freely available
(e.g. as PDF files through &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/"&gt;Project
Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the distractions of notifications everywhere, windows open to
social media, etc., you can more easily use your computing time
efficiently and get off without spending more time than you think is
appropriate. Free up time to tidy up your living space, get exercise,
catch up with people that are important to you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Networks of people and things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using chat or messenging apps often doesn't require looking at some
news feed (where ads and stuff are likely to appear). For instance,
there is https://www.messenger.com/ for Facebook messenger. Using a
dedicated messenging app (either on a phone or on the dekstop site)
may be preferable to using the more "full-featured" Facebook app or
Facebook website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how SMS messages and phone calls typically just... allow
people to communicate. Hopefully you don't encounter too much ads/spam
in these places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can try to keep our communication channels clear of
&lt;strong&gt;noise&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;stuff that isn't the conversations we're trying to
have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, shopping and other online activities can be done
purposefully. Keeping an old-fashioned shopping list (whether on some
text document on the computer or with pen/paper) and then buying stuff
from physical stores or the Internet is an effective way to prevent
impulse buying on the Internet. Furthermore, maintaining lists of
things you &lt;em&gt;may be interested in buying later&lt;/em&gt; is a good way to shield
from spending money you don't have to buy things you don't need. By
writing down stuff you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; want to buy later, you get the
satisfaction of documenting something you might not want to forget;
but also, you add a layer of protection against impulsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I outline some techniques anybody can use &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; mainstream
computing platforms, networks, and services for doing work, talking to
people and buying stuff that will also help you protect oneself
against media manipulation&amp;mdash;to which &lt;em&gt;nobody is immune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By organizing our technology usage with efficiency in mind&amp;mdash;and
giving ourselves options to work offline&amp;mdash;we can save our time
and attention from the campaigns of third parties. This way, we can
spend our resources on things that we &lt;em&gt;more actively&lt;/em&gt; decide are
important to us, rather than being responsive/reactionary consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don't like is when technology makes simple things &lt;em&gt;more
difficult&lt;/em&gt; and uses people's naivity and trust against them.
"Education" in the sense of telling people what things are (e.g.
when I call smartphones "&lt;strong&gt;personal surveillance devices&lt;/strong&gt;")&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

with new content. Narratives are swapped like pairs of sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk of "COVID-19" is rapidly replaced by other impending
matters&amp;mdash;in Sacramento, California with looting and rioting
nearby by suburb (though relatively peaceful, compared with other
cities) the new reason to stay inside is because of "curfew" rather
than airborn viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I got a letter in the mail from the IRS. This letter turned
out to be announcing the $1200 relief/aid money that came a couple
weeks earlier. A little white collar scare for me&amp;mdash;glad there was
no issue to deal with&amp;mdash;I paid muh taxes and stuff...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Permission to Live&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many peaceful channels by which people might normally deal with
frustration/anger are unavailable (if you would like to follow the
law, at least). Having friends over for dinner, taking a &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1412317-doomer"&gt;night
walk&lt;/a&gt;, and anonymously
loitering at a coffee shop are all off limits. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In place of everyday activities that help us learn about and connect
with the people around us, we have doom-and-gloom news piped directly
from to smartphone and brain&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, there are &lt;strong&gt;shibboleths&lt;/strong&gt; being used left-and-right to sort
out in-group loyalties. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urged to "speak out", many people feel compelled to announce stances
on issues&amp;mdash;to say nothing is to be complicit in the badness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have no idea what is going on in Syria, or Ukraine, or
Jamaica, or tons and tons of other places in the world. These places
are foreign to me; they are not in my backyard. Are there systemic
injustices in these places? Probably, I assume. Perhaps they have
political opinions about Asian-Americans living in Sacramento, CA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Guys/Bad Guys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, angst, anger, sadness, and frustration is
everywhere (particularly concentrated in urban areas where people are
exposed to more news and smartphones). Agitated cries for &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;
erupt&amp;mdash;what exactly should be done? A proletariat uprising?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this matter, America is far from united; things are getting
&lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that force is being used in many directions.&lt;/p&gt;

focus our attention elsewhere. Today I will be discussing &lt;strong&gt;gossip&lt;/strong&gt;
and how oftentimes I think it is a good thing because it reminds
people that the stuff they hear is often... &lt;em&gt;hearsay&lt;/em&gt; and that the
"truth" of some matter is not always what it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gossip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll define "gossip" as discussing &lt;em&gt;hearsay&lt;/em&gt;; speculating on what
might have happened based on reports (which may be first-hand
accounts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why does "gossip" have negative connotations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of the bad reputation of "gossip" is linked to its association with
&lt;em&gt;deception&lt;/em&gt;. Here are some &lt;a href="https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Gossip"&gt;Bible
verses&lt;/a&gt; related to the
topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your tongue from evil&lt;br&gt;
And your lips from speaking deceit.&lt;br&gt;
Psalm 34:13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, "gossip" is speaking deceptively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a
word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment,
so that it will give grace to those who hear.&lt;br&gt;
Ephesians 4:29&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verse above is about building up community in a church, using your
words to improve stuff rather than destroy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For lack of wood the fire goes out,&lt;br&gt;
And where there is no whisperer, contention quiets down.&lt;br&gt;
Proverbs 26:20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verse above sounds kinda like Chinese social cohesion; sometimes
it is prudent to hush up about stuff to allow some ship to continue
sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As illustrated from some verses chosen rather ad-hoc above, "gossip"
is understood to be a bad thing insofar as it is used to cause
conflicts and decieve. On the other hand, merely talking about other
people and your experiences would not be considered bad (or "idle")
talk as I interpret it if this talk is done with constructive aims in
mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reframing "gossip"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Gossip" in the sense that I defined it (discussing &lt;em&gt;hearsay&lt;/em&gt;)
requires that people form networks and hence establish trust with one
another. Gossip is a very useful way to maintain social cohesion and
maintain healthy scepticism of unverified parties' bold claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its foundation is &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt;; who is a trustworthy party to hear
information from? Who is tends to be a "click bait" flame fanner?
Who is 80% bullshit but 20% truth worth listening to? Understanding
gossip is knowing how to filter information from various voices,
establishing what who we think is credible and to be relied on, and
who is to be listened to with general skepticism (but expecting some
entertainment). Gossip is human communication that doesn't read like a
technical manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why listening to gossip is more helpful than "news"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying instincts for gossip (as old as humanity itself) to how we
engage with traditional news and online media, we can get a better
grip on what's really going on (as well as identify what we don't
know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often when reading the news, people take take the trustworthiness of
their source (e.g. the BBC, Voice of America) for granted rather than
investigating what kinds of agendas news outlets may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people gossip, they are often talking about something they've
heard about on a first or second hand account. Usually, the gossiper
has at least some "skin in the game" in the sense that they are
talking about people/events that they are personally concerned with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Professional Gossipers on a Global Stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are paid to gossip to large audiences. We call these
people &lt;em&gt;journalists&lt;/em&gt;, and it is not always clear where they get their
"facts" as well as agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of journalists (or at least the people giving them orders)
is huge&amp;mdash; much of "citation" that goes on these days involves
trusting some news source as a primary sources and then assembling
derivative opinions from what is reported as "facts/true". Something
becomes "a thing" when it is baptized by XYZ News Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are very knowledgable (first-hand) of some topic&amp;mdash;e.g.
chemistry, the Portuguese language, Sichuan cooking&amp;mdash;consider how
the second-hand reporting of journalism often &lt;em&gt;gets stuff wrong&lt;/em&gt; about
what you're saying. These same people that get stuff wrong about
things you are knowledgable about can surely be expected to get a lot
wrong about the facts of corrent events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why local news is often better than national/global news&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, local news can be expected to do a more decent job
reporting on local events just as friends gossiping can be expected to
do a more decent job on reporting the this-and-thats of people they
are involved with everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local news may be expected to be produced by (literally) closer to
&lt;em&gt;the ground&lt;/em&gt; people with a stake in how their communities turn out.
A local news outlet that is transparent about their biases (this could
even be a newsletter of a religious organization, hobby-centered club)
is even more trustworthy because &lt;em&gt;everyone has a bias&lt;/em&gt; and to
recognize and announce this is praiseworthy honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that claim to "only report the facts" or
something to that effect... are to be regarded with deep suspicion.
Same for news providers that claim to be unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happened to COVID-19?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social distancing effectively ends in many urban areas as masks become
a tools of anti-social rioting. The establishment (including rule of
law) is under seige from many independent actors, who may or may not
be getting their ideas from coordinated networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Grabbing my tinfoil hat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insofar as gossip makes people do-nothing-ers, spreading destruction
rather than building stuff up, gossip is no good. However, as a means
of maintaining networks (which is a form of &lt;em&gt;building something up&lt;/em&gt;),
gossip is very important for maintaining a network of &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;. People
gossip because they care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grand narratives about this-and-that "movement" in &lt;em&gt;national&lt;/em&gt; news on
the other hand... maybe not so easy to trust. Regarding the ongoing riots
across the US, what is going on? Some ideas to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=false%20flag"&gt;False flag
  operation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;could
  be happening in many directions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporting_bias"&gt;Reporting
  bias&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;could be
  used to present one group favorably over another, in contrast to the
  reality on the ground; e.g. portraying HK looters as heroic one day
  while demonizing looters in America the next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Reposting"&amp;mdash;some ideas can just get "memed" into credibility
  by being repeated enough times; an example of linguists complaining
  about this is the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/there-really-are-50-eskimo-words-for-snow/2013/01/14/e0e3f4e0-59a0-11e2-beee-6e38f5215402_story.html"&gt;"Eskimo Snow
  Hoax"&lt;/a&gt;;
  if some idea gets repeated enough, it &lt;em&gt;must be responded to&lt;/em&gt; by
  people who want to appear "in the know" about some topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional gossipers must inform people on what is not immediately
to them from observation, and in doing so convince them to act
according to their own grand agendas. The counter to being influenced
by these narratives is to have (free) conversations with people you
care about, establishing trust and building up a reputation with those
around you. "Put your money where your mouth is"&amp;mdash;tell your
friend that talks about this-and-that financial deal but never actualy
commits action to any of their opinions to shut up and go rake leaves
or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;no u&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don't do that much gossip and I don't think I would be
particularly good at it if I tried&amp;mdash;I'd probably end up arm-chair
philosophizing and pscyhologizing rather than saying anything of
substance. Nonetheless, I will typically prefer to listen to other
people gossip than hear them regurgitate stories they heard from
mainstream news outlets or repeat headlines of articles they browsed
on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News doesn't need to come from a "news outlet". Likewise, food doesn't
need to come from a restaurant (you can get it at a market and cook,
you can grow your own...). Your friends have stories&amp;mdash;Amazon
doesn't have a monopoly on story dispensing. You can organize your own
personal library and bookmarks rather than trusting Google to page
rank things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century, many people&amp;mdash;especially urban
dwellers&amp;mdash;are conditioned to drink the Establishment Soylent day
in and day out. Let us all try instead to listen to one another and
heighten our powers of observation, then turn to third parties of
dubious trust for additional input.&lt;/p&gt;

Cities&amp;mdash;as have been mentioned on this blog&amp;mdash;are sites where
the intoxication of words and the influence of mass media are
strongest. Cities are where people are free to live in abstractions,
not answering to the challenges (and truth) of the natural world.
Cities are often where people go to get money&amp;mdash;but oftentimes
that money comes at the price of losing touch with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greeks and Romans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm reading some stuff about Greeks and Romans. Recall that Romans
came after the Greeks and adapted many elements of Greek
cultures. However, Romans in many ways were practically-minded and
scheming politicians&amp;mdash;skilled in agrarian and military
things&amp;mdash;rather than idle philosophers and poets. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in a suburb, I am glad that I have at least some connection
with the "natural world" beyond the concrete jungle of a city. I have
access to a yard and some nice streets to pace around on as well...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish more people could just take some time off and go hiking in the
mountains or something. Breath in the nice mountain air... struggle
and be out of breath facing a natural barrier (e.g. gravity and slope
of a mountain) rather than constructing ideological enemies...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SpaceX Rocket Launch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the USA today also, we got a SpaceX rocket launch. What a nice,
positive thing for all sorts of people to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are getting too political, I advise you to shut up and learn
some technical skills and improve relationships with the people around
you. Upon doing that, you can use your big brane to make the world a
better place through organizing labor and developing better ways to do
things and you will have fun with friends/family while you're at it. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more research for me to do here, but this is the
general pattern as I understand it. Greeks had a lot more
plurality/diversity in the form of many city states... Romans did
more empire building.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people I know who are "overly political" in my opinion are
left-leaning folks pushed into constant angst by the legacy media.
There are some right-leaning people that are similarly "overly
political" in the sense that they want to implement their morality
into law... My personal opinion is that we should de-escalate
state power to the best of our ability such that there is no giant
gun lying on the floor for various political actors to wrestle
over. Insofar as the power of the state grows, so the potential
destruction your political opposition can wield increases. Let's
"de-escalate" and chill out, allowing decentralized progress and
peace.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

we're seeing arbitrary standard being put into place about what we can
and cannot say. I will not belabor the point of tech censorship, but
instead I will focus on how groups in power are allowed to talk about
whatever they want while simultaneously silencing other groups under
the pretense of terms like "hate speech". This essay is about how
certain groups are allowed to talk about politics as much as they want
while shutting down opposition. &lt;sup id="fnref:0"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I haven't looked at the Trump executive media
this-or-that&amp;mdash;my &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_efficacy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;political
efficacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is
pretty low, so I tend to be pretty stoic about political matters. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
I will not discuss the specifics of some law/policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is thus... just an analysis. I'm not trying to win your
vote or anything nor do I demand you to participate in some revolution
or change your Facebook profile picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's okay to talk about XYZ, as long as you agree with me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mainstream media (including social media, where this content is
often aggregated), we see ample "discussions" of all of the following
things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;race&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;social classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geopolitics (e.g. Hong Kong action; bad guy China)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these things are discussed openly, but certain positions are
not allowed to be articulated. This is the 1984/fake
news/etc. "matrix" of &lt;em&gt;controlled opposition&lt;/em&gt;. You are free to move
about in the same way as a train on tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, you can say Latinx female and non-binary individuals are
the target of oppression by you-know-who, so we need to allow for XYZ
in the name of human rights. However, if you were to create an exposé
on Latino (or some other Officially Oppressed ™ group) on East Asian
violence, you would probably get chased off social media by angry
mobs, unless all your friends happen to be Nazis. They would tell
&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; that you-know-who just wants to divide &lt;strong&gt;People of Color ™&lt;/strong&gt; to
keep them oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be forgiven if you say that you mis-spoke and that what you
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; meant was that XYZ aliens in such and such fictional universe
have legitimate greviances against ABC aliens.  Talking about
"nerd/geek" stuff like... the Marvel universe or Harry Potter or
something, you can see how all sorts of &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; can be
discussed&amp;mdash;but only in fictional worlds and the abstract.  It is
okay to talk about politics as long as you fall into line with current
political actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main point here is that there are certain narratives&amp;mdash;which
may be &lt;em&gt;very political&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that they're about how force is
used to change how people interact with another&amp;mdash;which are
perfectly okay to talk about at the dinner tables of many "nice
people". They have no problem with you talking about politics as long
as you agree with them. What there is a problem with is &lt;em&gt;disagreement&lt;/em&gt;
or lack of obedience&amp;mdash;e.g. refusal to regurgitate &lt;em&gt;talking
points&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, mantras of social alignment are repeated so that people can
signal which groups they belong to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So are you telling me that group XYZ are actually in power?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and no... You can imagine how different groups can win/lose the
favor of a ruling elite. For instance, the US government may prop up
Taiwan's KMT party one day and then later decide that they are corrupt
and "anti-democracy" and switch support to another group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't read much about what has been going on with ISIS and Syria
and all that, but I imagine studying that region or Latin America
would give some historical backing to the above claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm saying is that if you have a strong opinion about some
situation, e.g. the following issues,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Tibet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Hong Kong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cuban communism is not even that bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russia wants the worse for the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan needs more immigration because of an aging population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catholicism needs to reform for the 21st century&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christianity needs to "return to its fundamentals"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islam is "a religion of peace" (conversely, "Islam is the worst
  thing that has happened to the world since electric (non-gas)
  stoves")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...you may have been pressured by all sorts of top-down planning to
arrive at your conclusion. That's &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt;, but I urge you to consider
again hopping onto some political movement so as to not become
somebody else's "useful idiot".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fine to just say "I don't know enough about XYZ to form an
opinion" or even "I don't think the government should legislate on
ABC". When the time comes to have "skin in the game" and vote with our
feet/dollars, people &lt;em&gt;will make political decisions&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our tech overlords, tagged data sets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our silicon valley tech-utopian overlords would like us to tag and
label ourselves in all sorts of ways. This is how "machine learning"
and "big data" works. People create data by expressing choices among a
small set of discrete options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you come up with some "classification task", you can sort
desirable versus undesirable thinking. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that voting and democracy often works in a similar way. What we
are getting is a kind of automatic voting through opinion expressing
for our technocratic oligarchs to push their transhumanist ideals
incrementally on the unsuspecting consoomer masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hiding in my text editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past month or so, I've largely turned to arcane technical things
for personal development, entertainment, and network formation. &lt;sup id="fnref2:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Even talking about stuff like popular entertainment can get pretty
political pretty fast as talk about such-and-such discrimination
here-and-there and under/over representation this-and-that is often
the analysis of professional opinion-expressers. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, &lt;em&gt;many people don't want to be political&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;by
this I mean, we want to just go about our days &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; talking about how
groups leverage government (force) to accomplish their end-goals.
There are other things to use language for such as: displaying
affection towards one another, composing music and poetry, solving
difficult technical problems, learning the names of things
(e.g. muscle groups for sports training or drawing anime)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I present here is thus a rant about how normal people get nudged
into pushing politics to everything and how &lt;em&gt;we have a choice to be
less political&lt;/em&gt; by actively recognizing the double-standards applied
to "political speech" of all sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time I don't talk about politics... but when I do, I'd
rather hear most people reason abstractly about Starwars (omg light
side vs dark side) than talk about some not-so-well understood "facts"
reported from halfway across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:0"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know who is in power by what you aren't allowed to say.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muh politics lean libertarian (not too far from &lt;em&gt;liberal&lt;/em&gt;) which
means I want minimally state intervention. I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a globalist
in that I think we should have different nations pursuing
different policies and that we can't expect "free trade" and stuff
like that from political actors (states) playing by waaaay
different rules.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of software is not free from this either; see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NJIj47Tusw"&gt;"Keep

Smith, Our Prophet of Non-Bloat.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other "normal" interests like cooking, playing music, etc. are
great too. If you choose a rather obscure interest (e.g. some old
programing language) you may be more likely to meet people who
have explored similar ideas to you or have similar personalities&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pop open a can of Campbell's Chicken noodle soup and heat it over
the stove. I toss in some frozen peas for a nutritional boost, and
munch on a couple of carrots in the fridge while I wait for the soup
to heat up. I pace around the shade in my backyard a bit; the summer
heat is getting intense such that walking barefoot on the
concrete/stone would hurt. Some sad doggo is getting walked on these
hot surfaces as I write this, I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meditate upon the most recent Luke Smith video: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5UEuWMlqRI"&gt;"Enjoy the
Cyberpunk Dystopia of Proprietary
Software!"&lt;/a&gt;.  Yes, in
many ways we &lt;em&gt;are already living in a cyberpunk dystopia&lt;/em&gt;.  My matrix
portal machines (Windows PCs) hum in the background as I type here on
using a fancy &lt;a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/ergonomic_keyboards_index.html"&gt;"batman"
keyboard&lt;/a&gt; on an
older machine. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of the day, I hover among a handful of computers, none of
them bought as new, "state of the art" devices. I have a bunch of
monitors, of which two I had purchased and the rest I got for free
somehow. The machines I am using are not limiting me; it is my own
ability and organization that prevents me from doing
better&amp;mdash;locked indoors with these devices, some useful books and
reference materials, ...I'd probably emerge into the light as a more
skilled computer user than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often a difficult path to do this&amp;mdash;to go to the wilderness
away from the familiar and comfortable. Wandering in the desert is a
path that some have the luxury of choosing; perhaps more often than
not, it is a place where people just &lt;em&gt;end up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas &lt;em&gt;the jungle&lt;/em&gt; is a place filled with disease, things to kill
you, life forms all over... the desert is a relatively sterile place.
The desert feels &lt;em&gt;solitary&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;rather than having too much life all
around and being fearful of what might eat you, the desert presents
many mechanical, inorganic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has made many &lt;em&gt;cyberpunk dystopia jungles&lt;/em&gt;. There are eyes
(and apps) everywhere &lt;em&gt;watching&lt;/em&gt;. Some neighbors stand by ready to
report rule breakers. Signs and slogans abound like the colors of
poisonous animals warning potential predators away. People develop
venom and fangs, wings to jump between trees, and/or thick skin.  Life
is everywhere, but the form it is taking is not that of a fluffy
housecat. It is a ginormous puma lunging at your throat, a school of
piranha ready to devour whatever falls into the water, a bat (which
probably shouldn't be eaten in a soup)...&lt;/p&gt;

theme of "abstractions and reality". Gotta keep up momentum writing
stuff, even if some pieces are much better than others...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting humans into outer space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today SpaceX didn't get to launch a manned spacecraft into orbit
because the weather conditions didn't permit it. Conditions for
safe/successful flight were not met, so this launch was held off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff like &lt;em&gt;the weather&lt;/em&gt; will always be with us; water, wind, sunlight
etc.&amp;mdash;sometimes, from our cities with climate control we can
largely abstract these things away and turn our attention to other
education, entertainment, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when faced with a &lt;em&gt;very physically challenging task&lt;/em&gt;, like
getting humans into space&amp;mdash;well we must answer reality again. We
can control the weather in our living spaces to a large degree, but
we can't climate control the entire observable universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Policy, Software, Law...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the order imposed on the world is through human "layers of
abstraction". If you learn a lot about how some policy works, some
software application works, or some law works, you learn about a
particular &lt;em&gt;human-created configuration&lt;/em&gt; for things, which is
different from learning about the weather or biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placed on a desert island and forced to survive with only a hatchet or
something... what help does knowledge of California law, Photoshop, or
your health insurance policy provide you? Insofar as these things
help; you recognize useful categories in the world and train skills in
reckoning with reality, they are useful. Beyond that, they are
&lt;em&gt;locally valuable&lt;/em&gt; (only) in the sense that they can help you in a
particular time and place because people have decided to place value
on them, but this scope of worth does not extend to the metaphorical
desert island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer programer without a computer may have some skills to
systematize operations and get things up and running efficiently. But
this person's specialized skills in keyboarding, hardware
this-and-that esoteric knowledge, idiosyncratic know-how about
such-and-such programing language or library&amp;mdash;these things are
taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, skills in something abstract/fuzzy like "critical thinking"
or "problem solving" need concrete applications to be trained. This is
an (obvious?) reason why it isn't stupid to acquire a lot of
specialized knowledge, because it is in succeeding in some domain
(even human-created) that we train a more general fitness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;California continues opening up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Season of COVID-19 has brought in a new "local scope" of altered
social norms. Health care workers got a boost in prestige. "Conspiracy
thinking" got extra-demonized as media companies (including primarily
Internet-based ones) chose dug into their ideological/geopolitical
trenches. Some relatively introverted people have been having a really
great time while some tortured extroverts have turned to committing
misdemeanors to keep themselves from punching holes in walls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all of this, I see the "reality" (or &lt;em&gt;biology&lt;/em&gt;) of the whole
COVID-19 situation is still far from clear/resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other reasons, this is why I have focused in this blog on &lt;em&gt;what
I'm thinking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;pscyhologizing&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;speculating&lt;/em&gt; rather than trying
to tell you all &lt;em&gt;the facts&lt;/em&gt; about what is going on. I still think we
don't know much; though, I think that many of the ideas I've been
writing about here have been useful to me navigating these difficult
times.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 21</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-21.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-26T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-05-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-05-26:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-21.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the season of COVID-19, many people are struggling with "keeping

&lt;p&gt;In short, I …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the season of COVID-19, many people are struggling with "keeping
occupied" or fighting boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a look back at bygone eras in faraway lands, we can study
activities that people &lt;em&gt;spent a lot of time on&lt;/em&gt; for some guidance on
how to handle these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, I will argue that idle time is well-spent in &lt;em&gt;memorizing
things&lt;/em&gt;, whether this is technical/know-how things or cultural stuff
(e.g. a musical piece, scriptures/texts). By training our attention to
reproduce patterns of value we can find "internal stimulus"
(i.e. &lt;em&gt;motivation&lt;/em&gt;) to act with purpose wherever we happen to find
ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The "Work/Life Balance" Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Western paid-by-the-hour or salaried systems of working, many
of us have a fairly distinguished "on/off the job" mentality such that
we get ideas like &lt;em&gt;seeking a &lt;strong&gt;work/life balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;sup id="fnref:0"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It seems
that for most people, most of the time, such a strong distinction did
not exist; indeed people lived without clocks and stressful time
keeping for most of history. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events other than mechanical hands pointing to integers set the rhythm
of life. For instance, farmers worked according to seasons; craftsmen
had clear objectives of what they were doing&amp;mdash;this was their
trade. In Ecclesiastes, we read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under
the heaven:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecclesiastes 3:1 (KJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Time management" was not a problem that most people faced because
they either faced coercion (people telling them what to do) or
necessities for survival were evident enough. There may be "local
boredom" within doing some monotonous task, but the "tyranny of
choice" was less apparent because there were other forms of tyranny to
be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The season of COVID-19 is challenging for many people because, among
other reasons, external stimuli signalling time intervals for
this-and-that are absent. While schools would have bells and clocks
and short periods of time to shuffle between classes, such structures
are absent in most people's remote setups. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Times of Waiting: The "Four Arts"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have ample examples of people enjoying leisure time as well as
filling in long hours during periods. Today, I'll be talking about
Chinese aristocrats who had &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_arts"&gt;four favorite
activities&lt;/a&gt;: 琴棋书画 &lt;em&gt;qín qí
shū huà&lt;/em&gt; "musical instruments, chess, calligraphy, and painting". &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common thread among all of these activities is that they were all
&lt;em&gt;culturally valued&lt;/em&gt; and that they &lt;em&gt;indirectly trained abilities useful
elsewhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;qín&lt;/em&gt; "musical instrument" refers to a stringed instrument,
typically played as a solo instrument. The Chinese word for &lt;em&gt;piano&lt;/em&gt;
uses this same character: 钢琴 &lt;em&gt;gāngqín&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;in many ways the
Western classical music tradition jives well with Chinese interest in
mastering dealing with instrumental complexity (often as a soloist).
As with any other instrument (but particularly instruments used as
"solo instruments"), playing &lt;em&gt;qín&lt;/em&gt; required lots of practice and
study; memorizing a piece and then executing it well requires training
both hands and ears through many hours of concentrated practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar remarks may be made for chess playing. Good chess players do
not just play once or twice when they are bored&amp;mdash;they remember
what did and didn't work from previous games they have played (and so
good players will play &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of games). Nowadays, anybody who wants
to get serious at a strategy game of any sort (including online video
games) will have to memorize certain "openings" (including "item
builds" etc. in video games).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calligraphy is not just about reproducing words, but reproducing words
&lt;em&gt;in a particular way&lt;/em&gt;. To do calligraphy is to engage cultural
tradition, not just to make stuff "look pretty" or to go for "pure
functionality" (as some nerds may be predisposed to try). To do
calligraphy necessarily means looking beyond one's own likes and
engaging a literary heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there is painting; painting requires training find observation
skills and finding the "essence" of things&amp;mdash;Chinese brush
painting also takes an exceptional amount of dexterity because there
is no easy "undo" button for ink committed to paper. Speed of
execution is important to capture a bird flying away...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bored Chinese aristocrat would be better advised to engage seriously
in one of these activities rather than giving into vices like
drunkedness or disturbing the Confucian peace. When one grew weary of
any one of these, they knew of another art to pursue... While one
might specialize or have a favorite among the arts, learning to
appreciate all four of these can easily fill a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Modern Times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we'll call the modern equivalents of many of the
aforementioned activities "entertainment" or "hobbies"&amp;mdash;if they
happen to be prestigious or practical, we might call them "education"
or "training". &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have musical instruments; that connection is plain to see.
There are more applications for &lt;em&gt;qí&lt;/em&gt; "strategy games"; for instance
one may regard computer programing as a kind of battle against a
compiler/interpreter. I think that many video games&amp;mdash;insofar as
they are appreciated by society&amp;mdash;are similar to &lt;em&gt;qín&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;qí&lt;/em&gt; in
that they demand dexterity of the fingers as well as a strategic mind
to well. Most of us come from different traditions than Chinese
aristocrats, however we all have culturally important things to
copy, memorize and reproduce; we likewise have documents to compose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, exercising the "blog format" I may regard myself as a modern
practitioner of a kind of &lt;em&gt;shū&lt;/em&gt; "calligraphy". There is a small
technical element here (setting up a website, typing, etc.) comparable
to understanding the fundamental technical requirements of doing
calligraphy. Much of the challenge, however, comes from words and
meanings not the form alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to &lt;em&gt;huà&lt;/em&gt; "painting", there are many, many avenues these
days for expression in the graphic arts. On the one hand, we have
traditional painting, street sketching, photography, etc. to reproduce
what we already see in reality. Then, we have 3D modelling, digital
painting, etc. to create new images the world has yet to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time and Memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the "Four Arts" involves devoting lots of time and energy to
memorization of some sort. To be able to do something reflectively,
without slow deliberation, we must be trained in &lt;em&gt;how to arrive at
that information quickly&lt;/em&gt;; most quickly is through our minds. &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
artist that is pushing to improve in their arts is not bored because
they have skills to train, topics to research, and performances to
give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this era of information overload, I think much of our challenge as
modern people is to select among many options and choose a managable
number of things that we want to obtain advanced proficiency
in. Nobody has time to be good at everything, but developing strong
skills in a handful of activities is a great way to both (1) dispell
boredom, and (2) become more effective at acting in "the real world"
outside of that activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing these skills involves remembering patterns, and memorizing
stuff takes time. However, when we have more things memorized, we are
&lt;em&gt;always free to think and create&lt;/em&gt; regardless if our smartphones are
plugged in. We can spontaneously enjoy one another's company &lt;em&gt;without
worrying about whether such-and-such playlist will load and if there
will be ads&lt;/em&gt;. We are free from privacy concerns because we are not
entering things into Google's search engine through Microsoft's
operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. How Chinese aristocrats beat boredom &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; big
brother. Amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:0"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs and other businesspeople, stay-at-home parents,
performers, freelancers, and freeloaders all have their own
strategies for transcending the "work/life" duality&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall that precise time keeping really started getting
important for maintaining train schedules, so trains wouldn't hit
each other. Maybe this is just for going across time zones.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most organized among us can cleverly set up systems either
of their own design or modeled on their previous
workflow&amp;mdash;but this cannot be expected of most people...&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could get picky about how to translate each of the
characters of the "four arts"; for the purposes of this essay it
is not so important; also, thank you Amanda C for pointing out
that there also &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Arts"&gt;Six Arts&lt;/a&gt;
as the basis of (Confucian) education from the Zhou dynasty
onward.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life on earth often …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I spent some time shuffling around items to prepare for the
summer heat. Arrangements of stuff that may be comfortable in cooler
times may be unpleasant in hotter times. Adjusting stuff with changing
seasons venerable behavior with a history older than air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seasonal Adjustments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life on earth often revolves around &lt;em&gt;seasons&lt;/em&gt; of some sort. Often, we
hear about &lt;em&gt;four seasons&lt;/em&gt; from cultures of temperate climates &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but
people in other climates may talk about a "wet season" and a "dry
season" instead. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look at strategies for "beating the heat" we can turn to cultures
of hot weather places. Consider the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djellaba"&gt;&lt;em&gt;djellaba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Northern
Africa&amp;mdash;a "long, loose-fitting unisex outer robe with full
sleeves" (Wikip). This article of clothing is simultaneously cool (by
virtue of being loose-fitting) and offers some sun protection (through
having long sleeves, a baggy hood to protect from sun and sand blown
by strong desert winds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The human/cultural world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasons apply not just to what plants you can grow and staying alive,
but also to fashion, marketing, and other urban activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, we are experiencing a &lt;em&gt;special COVID-19&lt;/em&gt; season. The way
we dress/act/operate is responding to a change in the environment.
All of this is "cultural" in the sense that relatively few people are
directly influenced by the &lt;em&gt;biololgy&lt;/em&gt; of COVID-19 directly, though
"seasonal talk" is buzzing with people figuring out what "the new
normal" is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seasons of Solitude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Internet and stuff, COVID-19 is a new thing. But the ideas of
&lt;em&gt;isolation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;solitude&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;quarantine&lt;/em&gt; are not new ideas. We can
learn about how humans have dealt with these things in the past by
studying documents from hundreds of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In East Asia (China, Japan, Korea) there is lots of talk about
seasons; many Chinese things are named variations of "four
seasons" in English. A Japanese stereotype is to be "in touch with
nature", doing stuff like writing sensitive haikus about the
changing seasons.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will need to do some more research on different cultures' treatments
of seasons. Future blog posts on this maybe...&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Day&lt;/a&gt;, which is observed on
the last Monday of the month of May. There will be fewer picnics and
barbecues this year as policies in response to COVID-19 are still in
place. Law abiding citizens have still not recieved "the green light"
to go and spend time with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;End of Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, this "three day weekend" is no different from
weekdays or normal weekends. Work, social life, etc. means the same
sort of &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; thing&amp;mdash;waiting at home for some policy to give
options for &lt;em&gt;actively making things better&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There are economic 
limits to how much people can take; insofar as our current way of
doing money/economy operates in basically the same, we are witnessing
widespread strain&amp;mdash;perhaps threat of collapse in some places. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many scheduled things are still in place; businesses, schools, and
other organizations are doing what they can to honor
contracts&amp;mdash;delivering content online, following by phone,
etc. However, for many, the concept of "days" erodes as they "are just
waiting for all of this to end". The obedient and the conservative
wait; meanwhile many people move out to "test the waters" of the
re-opening world. Where I live now (Sacramento, CA), it seems that
"the flu times two" has been overestimated... &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response of many people is to return to daily life as much as
policy permits. Walking outside, I see groups of people (probably not
from the same household). People waiting for take out food stand
apart, but it seems they are honoring "personal space" more so than
"social distancing".  In other non-COVID times they wouldn't be
getting close and cozy with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain my schedule as usual, as much as I previously had a
schedule. Sometimes I try to add more schedule/structure than I used
to&amp;mdash;actively trying to structure my time more to squeeze out some
extra productivity. I suspect others are doing the same. Going out to
walk/jog, I see lots of routine-governed-looking people walking dogs
and stuff so I think I'm not alone in this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Next Reaction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will stuff proceed from here? As expressed in &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-6.html"&gt;Part
6&lt;/a&gt;
of my Corona Virus Diary, I think that we will &lt;em&gt;not see a "universal
vaccine"&lt;/em&gt;. Without a decisively helpful medical thing, I think that
the next events people will need to respond to will primarily be
dealing with policies of various "stages" of re-opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insofar as economic activity seems to be recovering, politicians will
be eager to take credit for stuff going well and will encourage
additional re-opening. Insofar as COVID-19 seems to be a scary
disease, we'll see conservative measures of keeping stuff shut
down&amp;mdash;politicians don't want to be credited for being heartless,
death reapers overseeing the disaster for economic gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than seeing a shift towards &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; digital stuff, I think that
this COVID-19 situation has reminded many people of how important the
face-to-face interaction aspect of school/business/etc. is&amp;mdash;I
predict many people explicitly choosing &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; options when possible,
especially after this stuff fizzles out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that COVID-19 will have a lasting impact on "trusting of
experts"; people from all sorts of political camps have seen how
money, influence, etc. has pushed the sort of narratives that various
actors and organizations promote. Maybe in another post I'll further
discuss my thoughts on how perceptions of "globalism" are
changing... Let it suffice to say for now that many students' study
abroad plans have effectively been trashed by Corona-chan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine? OK from government to re-open? Celebrating health care
workers is easy from the comfort of my home with finances going
alright&amp;mdash;for those getting economically smacked down, living
vicariously through celebrating people "doing the right thing" in
cute/fun YouTube videos isn't so viable as rent is due&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of alternate moneys/economies include people who have
food/shelter/"money" that don't depend on the US dollar (thinking
about things from an American perspective here; same analysis can
probably be generalized). There are ways to get food/shelter
besides using money, e.g. somebody in need staying over at a
friend's place or moving back in with family. Here, &lt;em&gt;social
capital&lt;/em&gt; and a reputation of being an agreeable, respectful person
pays more than capitalistic ambition.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term expression "flu times two" (or some other &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;) implies
that this whole COVID-19 thing &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; worse than a "normal" flu
season, but probably not on the magnitude justifying the
scale of responses we've seen governments rolling out.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

accept the "new normal" of locked-in life as they wish to stay where
the air conditioning is anyways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To feel the heat is to be reminded of nature&amp;mdash;the stuff that
civilization shields us from. To find a cold shower refreshing is to
re-create some of the experience of jumping into a refreshingly cool
lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans did not evolve to sit in ergonomic chairs for 8-ish hours a
day &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; we are optimized to forage, to hunt, and to form groups (tribes).
When we are bored, we paint, make music, and play
sports/games. Through these activities, we learn to obey rules/norms,
respect our competition, and resolve conflicts. Also, we have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being clever with abstractions some of us can convince their bodies
that they are doing the aforementioned activities. Dueling with mind
power at work then going to an intense workout afterwords may be
sufficiently convince the body that one has planned and executed a
successful hunting expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No new news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above thoughts are not original; they have, for instance, been
(in)famously recorded in &lt;em&gt;Industrial Society and Its Future&lt;/em&gt; by
Theodore "Uncle Ted" Kaczynski. &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his chapter
&lt;a href="http://xahlee.org/p/um/um-s06.html"&gt;"Surrogate Activities"&lt;/a&gt;,
Kaczynski describes how some people are able to find fulfillment in
activities that aren't immediately useful to their survival like
hunting is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and
    demoralized. For example, the emperor Hirohito, instead of
    sinking into decadent hedonism, devoted himself to marine
    biology, a field in which he became distinguished. When people
    do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs
    they often set up artificial goals for themselves. In many cases
    they then pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional
    involvement that they otherwise would have put into the search
    for physical necessities...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all this COVID-19 stuff, we'll see images/news
articles/etc. saying how "easy" it is just sit on the couch and "do
nothing" while such-and-such heroes solve this pandemic for us. Why
should anyone complain when they are being asked to do something so
simple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncle Ted elaborates,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to
    satisfy one's physical needs. It is enough to go through a
    training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then
    come to work on time and exert very modest effort needed to hold
    a job. The only requirements are a moderate amount of
    intelligence, and most of all, simple OBEDIENCE. If one has
    those, society takes care of one from cradle to grave. (Yes,
    there is an underclass that cannot take physical necessities for
    granted, but we are speaking here of mainstream society.) Thus
    it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate
    activities. These include scientific work, athletic achievement,
    humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, climbing the
    corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far
    beyond the point at which they cease to give any additional
    physical satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses
    issues that are not important for the activist personally, as in
    the case of white activists who work for the rights of nonwhite
    minorities. These are not always pure surrogate activities,
    since for many people they may be motivated in part by needs
    other than the need to have some goal to pursue...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is happening for many people during lock-down is that they are
&lt;em&gt;doubly&lt;/em&gt; locked-down. First, is the normal lock-down of socialization
(which involves turning natural instincts to surrogate
activities). Now, as many of these surrogate activities are taken
away, people are asked to... ...watch others doing surrogate
activities? Play video games to simulate some surrogate activities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facing the heat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing to not turn on the AC is decisive step in &lt;em&gt;facing the
heat&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;re-engaging "natural" human struggle. Most of us are not
farmers, hunters, and the like&amp;mdash;we are deeply embedded in
industrial society. It is not difficult to imagine why this is very
difficult for those of us who are not particularly abstraction-adept,
introverted, obedient and/or already off the grid somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actively choosing to face (physical) difficulties of various sorts is
a step towards re-engaging the human knack for problem solving,
community formation, etc. Problems with motivation are "irrational"
insofar as we uncritically believe the axioms handed down to us by
depressed happiness researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to slowly &lt;em&gt;observe&lt;/em&gt; and learn from direct sensation rather
than words, words, and more words is a step towards reconnecting with
reality. If words are needed, texts at least 100 years old are
preferrable for wisdom, informally published stuff by laypeople (like
yours truly) is good fun for the "modern" stuff 😛&lt;/p&gt;

outside in circles is less pleasant. Sometimes I have to step off the
sidewalk or otherwise navigate around an obstructing
trashcan. Sometimes I have to move to dodge some stink.  On top of
that, there are leaf blowers filling the morning peace with noise, a
person or two standing in the shadows possibly doing drugs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure exists; my city is still going. Otherwise, there would
be no trashcans out to be picked up. This much is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reach a bridge overlooking a freeway. The road doesn't look great
(trash and stuff around, some areas in need of repair), but its scale
is impressive&amp;mdash;it vanishes into the horizon. If someone told you
that you had to run across the freeway, you might feel tired just
thinking about it. Cars move quickly because traffic is significantly
reduced during these COVID-19 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the freeway bridge is a train station. I don't really know who
uses this train &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it is there and it is operational. Heaven
knows that there are people in other cities all over the place
petitioning for funds to be allocated to build a train. I like to pace
around on the train platform sometimes because there are no cars to
hit me there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rack for fancy bikes to rent stands empty &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The past year or so
I rode these a few times; it was really fun to ride an
electric-assisted bike, especially when visiting Davis (about half an
hour or so from Sacramento; where I did grad school and still have
some contacts) so I wouldn't have to disassemble and bring my own
bicycle. Are these gone temporarily? Or will they be gone for good,
with skeletons of charging stations past littering these
semi-corporate streets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is less strained under COVID-19 because overall there is less
movement. Like an exercise in fasting, the city itself is probably
"thankful" for the reduction in traffic. There is time to chill out,
to heal. City road work and stuff resumes (I've heard and seen it)
with less interrupting traffic. Some experimental things (like the
JUMP bikes) may or may not return; is this like trying alcohol during
college and then quitting afterwards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm wearing a hat fit for a relaxed boomer barbecue paired with some
dark sunglasses (아저씨 패션); it is the season where looking shady is
the way to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get bothered. For this morning, I enjoy LARPing as an
industrialist surveying their city from the ground level rather from a
fancy VIP suite. The sober stillness of underused infrastructure is my
pacing ground, the gasoline motors of gardening power tools provide my
industrial soundtrack...&lt;/p&gt;

makes stuff feel better. Staying in the same room, even if doing
exercises like pushups and stuff, is not the same as using one's feet
to move about. The explainers of the world may speak of Vitamin D or
Serotonin or all sorts of other things I do not understand&amp;mdash;maybe
they are right. I do not feel like reading such-and-such scientific article
now; I walk outside because it is what I want to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I wear no mask and likewise do not walk near anyone. I just
wanna go for a walk. I don't want to have to think about such-and-such
rules. I just want to live and let live; can I just cherish some &lt;em&gt;muh
freedoms?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, no words are needed to explain why a walk is nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Word Governed World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall visiting Tokyo, Japan. One thing that stood out to me was
that there were &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; everywhere, all the time. A door opens&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doa-ga akimasu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"The door is opening"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...a door closes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doa-ga shimarimasu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"The door is closing"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verbiage was overwhelming. Words everywhere all the time, imposing
their model of the world into the minds of the city dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Muh Roads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the novel IQ84, Haruki Murakami alludes to Anton Chekhov's
&lt;em&gt;Sakhalin Island&lt;/em&gt; (1893-94) travel diary, describing a people group
who &lt;em&gt;have no need for roads&lt;/em&gt;. Roads are important in a modern, urban
societies because we need things like addresses to ship stuff, flat
surfaces for large garbage trucks to roll over, and so on and so
forth. For a more "primitive" group of people, roads are not so
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail runner may complain about how coating everything in concrete
destroys runners' knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Muh Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar way to how roads impose civil order on the ground,
&lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; are used to impose civil order in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before having words distinguishing such-and-such from this-and-that,
the distinctions may not be present in people's minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I hear many overseas Chinese people upset that
non-overseas Chinese laypeople do not understand distinctions like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Born Chinese versus "China Chinese"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taiwan vs China vs Hong Kong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandarin vs Cantonese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These distinctions are clear to a person cultured into a particular
way; mislabeling could get you into a lot of trouble socially!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet to the South Asian living in the West, these issues may not be so
apparent. Overseas Chinese issues are just all &lt;em&gt;foreign&lt;/em&gt;. Likewise,
most Overseas Chinese probably think very little of issues like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India vs Pakistan vs Bangladesh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hindi vs Punjabi vs Marathi vs Gujarati...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hindu vs Muslim vs Sikh...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North vs South Indian style cuisines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particular words and concepts are useful for particular contexts,
which are often culture specific. Trapped on a desert island with a
motley crew of people of diverse backgrounds, the utility of many of
these distinctions rapidly diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The COVID-19 News Cycle Withdrawal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 situation continues, I am seeing more and more people
"checking out" of trying to keep up with news and stuff. Some of these
people are avid "media junkies" who pride themselves on their volume
of consumption and info-hoarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were given words to describe this situation; do they have any
utility?  Insofar as we follow basic directives to protect one
another, words can be useful. But at a certain point, more information
does nothing of utility; we are "locked-in" and made to follow rules.
People will just do what they do, so long as they do not get in
trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, we cross streets freely when there are no cars even if it is
"jay walking" (a crime?!). What are the laws on this? Insofar as it
doesn't concern their safety, I think most people don't know.  Until I
have to renew my driver's license or something again, I won't know
either.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 15</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-15.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-19T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-05-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-05-19:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-15.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today's topic is &lt;em&gt;making progress learning technical skills&lt;/em&gt;.

"technical" here I am talking about skills where there is a clear,
measurable way to tell how some result is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, drawing realistically&amp;mdash;or emulating the style of a
particular artist&amp;mdash;may be viewed as a technical skill. On the
other hand, evaluate "are these blog posts getting &lt;em&gt;better?&lt;/em&gt;" is not
so easy &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Technical skills are vital for creative expression
because they are the vehicle by which you can form and express
ideas. Weak technical skills means weak expressive capacity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I will introduce some ideas I have useful and give examples of
how I have applied these ideas. In this way, I will give a kind of
journal of some of successes and failures and remind myself of what
has(n't) worked for me; maybe it will be useful to you too or at least
fun to read ¯_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, have projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Projects" are some concrete goal you can work toward &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Some projects
are very-well defined. For example, you may have goals to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay off student debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Produce a painting a week for a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn German to a conversational level before visiting Germany&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a website for a friend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-establish contact with at least four friends over the next month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things may be more abstract. Though, I think that if you can
&lt;em&gt;visualize&lt;/em&gt; it, it can be a project. Can you imagine the "conditions
of success" for your project?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel comfortable talking about XYZ&amp;mdash;you probably have at least
  &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; you feel comfortable talking about, e.g. your pet
  cat. You can therefore conceptualize what it might &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like to be
  able to talk about some topic comfortably. You can see examples of
  people doing such-and-such on YouTube and visualize yourself doing
  the same&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve your relationship with some family member/mutual
  acquaintance/etc.&amp;mdash;you may not know exactly how this will look
  with such-and-such particular person you are going to have to spend
  some time with, but you may have positive examples of working
  relationships to turn to as inspiration for how stuff might work out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn to Code&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;what does this even mean? You can measure your
  success on this based on your ability to make a project of XYZ scale
  or go through ABC cirriculum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having projects is important because they give you something to align
your efforts with. Broad projects, get broken up into small
sub-tasks&amp;mdash;such as doing math problems everyday towards a broader
project goal of "achieving basic mathematic proficiency". Looking at
your own activities in relation to projects means you can evaluate if
what you're currently doing is moving you towards or away from your
goals. You may find that getting
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shwasted"&gt;shwasted&lt;/a&gt;
on Friday night is not conducive to "finding peace and happiness with
a stable family"&amp;mdash;your time may be better spent doing activities
that will earn you money, improve your health, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that many people naturally excel at creating projects for
themselves on-the-fly. For example, a person naturally interested in
anime may set themselves over completing many "goals" of studying
Japanese by compulsively watching through lots of anime series,
investing effort to take notes of new vocabulary and such as they
go. This &lt;em&gt;hataraki-mono&lt;/em&gt; ("hardworking") weeb may succeed gloriously
at learning Japanese quickly and efficiently because little planning
is needed&amp;mdash;interest drives serial "project creation".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write about explicitly selecting and choosing projects because one
of my problems is that I start way too many different projects and
"spread my efforts too thin". By explicitly figuring out what my
projects are and keeping inventory, I can better select which projects
&lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; need my attention and turn my efforts towards the goals most
important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coming up with projects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started with a new project can be daunting, but also lots of
fun. It may mean you get to take a shopping trip, set up a new
calendar where you plot and scheme your road to glory...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also be useful to re-think activities that you are already
doing in the context of "projects" if you have hit a plateau in
progress and are not satisfied with how things are currently (not)
improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways you can establish new projects or "cast" things you
are already doing into projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Work through a comprehensive resource&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textbooks can be very helpful. Undergraduate classes I've taken have
rarely gotten through an &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; textbook. So if there was some
subject that you would like to learn about (e.g. biology) picking up a
book on such-and-such subject and working through &lt;em&gt;all the chapters&lt;/em&gt;
can be a fine way to get a comprehensive, "canonical" understanding of
any given subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to re-work through the fundamentals of something you
already know how to do. For instance, I already know some basic of
reading music, but I kind of suck at playing piano. To get better, I
acquired some easy-ish classical music. By working seriously (as an
adult learner) through training materials I can improve.
Playing through &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; piece in such-and-such book may help me
improve on areas I am weak in (e.g. playing complex rhythms) even if
these pieces aren't as "fun" at first because I suck at playing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working through a comprehensive resource will help you find what you
are good at and what you are not so good at and give you obvious 
areas to "flag for improvement".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Build something&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you try to build something rather than just solve some
pre-prepared problem you will soon discover what you have to study and
what skills you lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it is easy to passively "study" a foreign every language
by playing some songs in that language. Sooner or later, you may just
listen to that music passively, zoning out and doing other stuff while
learning zero Spanish (or whatever language you happen to be
studying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you may want to do is &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt; a repertoire of songs/lyrics you
actually &lt;em&gt;have memorized&lt;/em&gt;. This will involve picking and choosing
songs that are meaningful enough to you that they are worth studying.
In doing this, you will likely come across idioms that surprise you,
words you find you didn't know, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples of building stuff include,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a finished work of art&amp;mdash;not just quick, fast sketches,
  but a painting that will take you many days (or even weeks, months)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a nexus of communication for you and
  friends/family&amp;mdash;e.g. create a Discord server and input your own
  content there everyday for a month to get activity buzzing;
  personally invite/promote your project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring Linux to your liking from a relatively basic
  setup&amp;mdash;may be a pain in the butt, but you will learn a lot
  about how stuff is clobbled together to produce a decent "user
  experience"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes building is just putting in the blood/sweat/tears needed to
get something done. This can be more refreshing than wallowing around
in indirection sometimes even if it is difficult in another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, other times you may be pleasantly surprised at how &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt;
work you have to do to build something nice&amp;mdash;this may be because
you find ways in which you can bring other people into your
project(s).  Projects involving others may gain a life of their own
and continue organically grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a knack for getting projects started, putting in concentrated
effort, and then seeing stuff just kinda... work out is called &lt;em&gt;being
enterprising&lt;/em&gt;. Fantastic! You can then choose to stay involved with
your own project or hand off (or sell) your "startup" to some other
party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Optimize some metric&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another class of projects is &lt;em&gt;making some number go up/down&lt;/em&gt;. For
instance, you may have a goal of running three miles in under 30
minutes. Metrics are good because you can measure your progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, metrics can be bad because they can be misleading on
measuring what you're really interested in. For instance, you might be
measuring your body &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; but be more interested in feeling healthy
overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Let somebody else give you a project&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everybody has to be a "leader"; choosing to follow people whose
goals align with your own can be a shortcut to a life well-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a good teacher/coach/manager can be very helpful because it
means someone who has seen more of some domain than you can guide you
to make faster progress than you could on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting somebody else assign you projects, and following their
directives is also a fine way to occupy one's time productively
towards ends that at least someone else cares about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work on your projects frequently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people, the easiest way to ensure frequent work on projects
is a schedule. Others hate schedules and still get a lot
done. Typically, the more projects you will have the more sort of
structure you'll need to continue making progress at all of them.
If you only care about doing one or two things well, your whole life
can take shape around doing these things without much planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, having &lt;em&gt;too many projects&lt;/em&gt; is often an issue for me. For
example, I'm interested in studying many different languages. But
every minute I put towards studying Korean is a minute that &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt;
spent studying Chinese. Here, I just have to make a choice about what
I am prioritizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attention is the secret sauce&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have some projects to work on, you need to put attention into
them.  Note that &lt;em&gt;attention&lt;/em&gt; is different from &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;; you can put
lots of &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; into watching tutorial videos and learn
nothing. However, if you bring your attention to actively work on
problems, &lt;em&gt;you will learn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes focusing attention means &lt;em&gt;turning off distractions&lt;/em&gt;. You
may be surprised how much progress you can make &lt;em&gt;focusing&lt;/em&gt; on some one
thing for not so much time, e.g. 15 minutes a day. If you had spent 15
minutes per day studying XYZ foreign language for the past 5 years, do
you reckon you'd know a lot by now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is when we get overwhelmed (often by our attention getting split)
that we fail to allocate attention, though we may spend a lot of
&lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; suffering. It is easy to spend a miserable Saturday "kinda
studying" from 10 AM till 10 PM; perhaps 2 hours of concentrated
studying, interrupted by 6 hours of video games, followed by 2 more
hours of concentrated studying would be better. That is being honest
with oneself about the need to rest, recover, and "do nothing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If it helps, embrace tracking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some stuff, we value the "muh freedoms". For other work, being
tracked means documenting that you are working hard and trying to make
good use of your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know when to quit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing projects through milestones you set can also be a good way
to decide when to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; some effort and spend your energies
elsewhere. For example, I spent some time studying
&lt;a href="https://golang.org/"&gt;Golang&lt;/a&gt;, Google's C++ alternative programing
language with a nice syntax. I worked through the exercises in the
official "&lt;a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1"&gt;A Tour of Go&lt;/a&gt;"
documentation over a long while. Eventually, I realized that I didn't
really need Golang to solve the sorts of problems I was currently
facing; spending time on this language was also keeping me from making
progress learning other technologies like UNIX utils (&lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) and improving my JavaScript. So I stopped studying Go
&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizing your projects&amp;mdash;which involves "pruning" ones that are
no longer relevant to you&amp;mdash; encourages pro-active decision making
in life. You can determine what is worth your attention and what is
not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary and Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can improve on technical skills by having clearly defined
&lt;em&gt;projects&lt;/em&gt; (which may in turn lead to many sub-projects). Keeping
inventory of which projects you have and making sure you always have
concrete goals to work towards ensures you are always improving your
skills or building some thing (material, social, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By selecting which projects you continue, marking off projects as
"complete", and sometimes pruning projects that aren't going anywhere,
you exercise agency over your life and will feel good. Likewise,
choosing &lt;em&gt;not to begin projects&lt;/em&gt; is an exercise in confidently saying
"no" because you know your own stuff well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you establish a good record for successfully completing projects,
your "YES" and your "NO" will both be well-respected by those who know
you because you will have established that you have a pattern of
planning, executing, and when necessary making clear decisions to abandon ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I could optimize for &lt;strong&gt;metrics&lt;/strong&gt; like length of an
article, number of views, and so forth&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/strong&gt; methodology I've mentioned at
least a couple times on this blog, all organization is centered
around driving projects of various sorts to completion.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being at least; it was fun to study Go, but I have
other priorities currently&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

account. I hadn't cleaned out this inbox for a month or two so. On
this email account I'm subscribed to some newsletter things, so I was
able to take a step back and view how the whole "COVID-19 pandemic"
&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; has unfolded, from a kind of third-person, detached
historian's perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Unwritten Narrative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this saying that, "hindsight has 20-20 vision"&amp;mdash;when
looking at the past we can feel all clever and sharp minded &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  It
is easy to say to oneself, "ah yes, I was right about such-and-such"
because we can pick and choose statements we have made and aggregate
them into a 100% correctly guessing narrative. The hazier these
statements are, the easier this task is because there will always be
wiggle room to get out of falsification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one danger of chilling out and just "analyzing". You can
analyze all day; what makes your analysis valuable? Telling somebody
else that they should have listened to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First, instruct yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have "skin in the game" is to act on one's word. Saying words
about stuff is OK, but as another saying goes&amp;mdash;"actions speak
louder than words". If we are so clever in our predictions, we should
act on those predictions and reap the benefits of having seen what
others could not. You don't have to worry about others recognizing
that you &lt;em&gt;were right about such-and-such&lt;/em&gt; if you reap material rewards
for your predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, I am enjoying wealth in that I had bought enough toilet
paper&amp;mdash;I heard news of trouble getting this stuff relatively
early on from East Asia. Hooray! Glad I purchased that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I haven't really profited financially much from all
this COVID-19 action. As many stock prices plunged and crypto did what
crypto does (be volatile), I decided that I didn't even wanna
think/deal with this. I wanted some money on hand to pay for stuff
too, so I didn't "buy the dip" &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Recalling how much of a pain in
the butt to file taxes for 2019 I didn't wanna deal with all the
capital gains stuff if I did indeed profit nicely. So I opted to not
"play the stock market" and instead focus my time/attention on nerd
stuff (technical learning for work) and self-improvement stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite lazy and not clever enough about the financial stuff in
retrospect; I just withdrew and let the market (and the Federal
Reserve and friends) do what they do. Now, I get my default rewards&amp;mdash;
magical money inflating prices despite slowed down economic
activities, less complicated finances/taxes for the coming year... But
you know... I could have made more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel okay about the decisions I made with regards to stocks and
stuff though because I got what I bargained for&amp;mdash;freed attention
to concern myself with other things, rather than watching lines to up
and down &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reject Economy, Embrace Gains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to my total under-achieving in terms of shuffling integers
(trading stocks) during this Bat Pestillence, I've been able to
extract "guaranteed returns" in some of my own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing and making predictions about what other people do is often a
risky game. On the other hand, working on your own understanding of
stuff and developing your skills often is a pretty &lt;em&gt;work hard and get
paid&lt;/em&gt; type of setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing yourself makes you better prepared to enter riskier
situations later; for example, if you are playing a sport, to maximize
your chance of winning a competiton, you gotta train. Duh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of the media we consume is by people trying to establish
themselves as experts on such-and-such, telling you why you should
care about this-and-that, and so on and so forth. When do we regret
keeping up with that sort of content?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading some old newsletters, I would say... it is fun to keep up with
news to understand humor/memes/stuff people may share with each
other. But to keep up with a bunch of random stuff that has no bearing
on one's own life&amp;mdash;I think that most often when I look over some
stack of stuff I &lt;em&gt;didn't read&lt;/em&gt; I don't wish I had consoomed more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, people rarely regret having studied a marketable skill,
completing a workout routine, cultivating a network of friends/family...
This is no new news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the most present interpretation of some world
happenings doesn't mean it is "right"; "hindsight has 20-20
vision" is more like knowing how a novel unfolds than knowing
about &lt;em&gt;what actually happened&lt;/em&gt; for lots of stuff&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

from yesterday and prepare a new pot of coffee for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Siberia"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a corner of the yard in the place I am renting which I call
&lt;em&gt;Siberia&lt;/em&gt;.  When I first moved to that location, there was a pile of
broken stuff there&amp;mdash;rotting wood stakes, a broken broom (the
straw bristles of the broom were almost gone, though the handle still
was intact), and a trash bin thing filled with spider webs &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is to Siberia that plants with harmful fungus/insects are sent,
where occasionally coffee grounds are dumped, and where an occasional
unappetizing potato or onion beyond cooking is cast. In this way, it
serves as an informal compost heap. It is also a place where plants
which might get thrown out as to not infect other plants are given a
fighting chance to rid themselves of their sickness and emerge
stronger than before. &lt;em&gt;Siberia is a chance for redemption&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I pace to-and-from in the yard&amp;mdash;perhaps while trying to find
some solution to some technical problem&amp;mdash;I arrive at Siberia at
one end of my route. In the winter, it was rather barren. But as
spring arrived and now as we head towards summer, Siberia teems with
life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not ordered; there are no plants arranged in nice rows, no vines
climbing allocated pole things. It is a garden cultivated in
chaos. The plants living there take what they can get and they fight
to organize waste into a chance to live, prosper, and reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plants of Siberia need no instruction from me; they will be
well-behaved carbon off-setters regardless of my input. This is very
unlike websites, which I build for my day job. Neglect of websites
means decay. Abandonment means growth stops. A website that is not
frequently updated makes visitors wonder "is this &lt;em&gt;still a thing?&lt;/em&gt;".
Plants are &lt;em&gt;still a thing&lt;/em&gt; even if we ignore them and stomp on them as
they grow between sidewalk cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Smell of Frugality and Civic Society&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is seven something AM; I realize that the "vibe" around me reminds
me of my (K-12) school. In California, most students have to wake up
around 7 something. They will experience the "7 am air" as they hop in
a car, loiter around the school gates, ride a bicycle to school, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no stop to a luxurious coffee shop today (as we are under
COVID-19 lockdown). During college and grad school, I would do stuff
like that all the time&amp;mdash;pay a couple of bucks to loiter somewhere
before carrying out my duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I get a similar feeling to being back in grade school because I
am being frugal and not going out to buy stuff; I can scrounge around
the kitchen for whatever if I am hungry or thirsty. Or I can just sit
on the floor and type away at my computer, transcending the "material
realm".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today feels very... not corporate. It feels "civic" in a nice way. The
world is not screaming at me with advertisements because I've set up
my computing/media stations to get rid of that &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  Maybe, I can say
it feels more "martial" in the sense that I am not really thinking
much about market pressures and stuff. I'm planning and preparing for
the week ahead, keeping logs like this, and organizing and maintaining
stuff. I'm not thinking about what to
&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/consume-product-consoomer"&gt;consoom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the opposite of "abstracting"?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not concern myself with some silly hyper-verbal discussion
about whether today feels more "civic" or "martial"; I am here to
describe stuff&amp;mdash;feelings dump, narrate diary style this-and-that.
The text analysis ("Natural Language Processing") programs can conduct
whatever classifications they want on what I write here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plants of Siberia care not for my abstractions or yours. I pace
to-and-fro thinking of solutions to technical problems. When that is
tiring, I can interact with other people and enjoy the human realm.&lt;/p&gt;

deposit a check. Though I didn't really &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to drive, I figure it
is useful to make sure my car starts at least once every couple weeks;
I haven't been outside of a small, less than two hundred meter radius,
of where I live recently anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to my ATM, I pass some businesses. As it was pretty early
in the morning, most weren't open, but some were and they were hopping
with customers.  The drive through line for Starbucks line was
long&amp;mdash;spilling out into the main street. Trader Joes had lots of
people filtering through the parking lot. Maybe about 1/8 people I saw
were wearing a mask of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shopping center where my ATM is located has a relatively big
supermarket. The parking lot was by no means full (expected) but there
was a regular shuffle of people going in and out. Lots of loitering
type activity all around, though this particular shopping center
usually clamps down pretty hard on that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a pretty nice day outside. I cook up a pot of legalized
stimulants (caffeine via coffee). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, stuff is still going. People find ways to communicate
with each other. People find ways to get enough to eat. People find
places to sleep. Announcements of children to be born do not stop. 
Maybe fewer people are getting married within the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the "news cycle" continues. Every day there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be
stories. Eyes must scan newsfeeds and see advertisements. Some people
I know would go to McDonalds anyways even if there weren't
advertisements for months. But the dining halls of the (corporate)
public space are still closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear private conversations beginning with, "of course nothing is

&lt;em&gt;words and thinking&lt;/em&gt;. I'll elaborate more below, but the main way this
all relates to COVID-19 is that &lt;em&gt;the primary way most of us understand
what's going on is through words&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words are great for lots of things, but they have their
limitations. There are many &lt;strong&gt;non-verbal&lt;/strong&gt; ways to think about stuff,
e.g. spatially, in terms of math, through working with programing
languages,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinaesthetics"&gt;kinaesthetically&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger of thinking about things mainly (or exclusively) in verbal
terms is the ease at which &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; can be associated with &lt;em&gt;emotions&lt;/em&gt;.
While we think we are learning about the world, we can easily get
wrapped up in somebody's "Matrix of words" &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The lock-in policies
of governments around the world are making words increasingly
important because words are now serving&amp;mdash;more than ever&amp;mdash;as
the main interface by which people are finding out about the world
beyond their locked-in doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Words as an interface to understand the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lock-in policies mean people learn about more and more things
indirectly/vicariously through words. We are not going outside and
observing things directly as much as before; we are taking what people
say to us on &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of COVID-19 exacerbates this situation. COVID-19 is an
"invisible enemy" &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; we can't see it like we might see flying
saucers in the sky or giant sea monsters at our coasts. It is even
less visceral than climate change, which we can see in pictures of sad
polar bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Words are everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words permeate thinking in lots and lots of places. Here's some examples,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Songs&lt;/strong&gt; as the most popular form of music; music set to &lt;strong&gt;lyrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Videos&lt;/strong&gt; associate words with images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verbal Explanations&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;using "different words" to try to
  express the meanings of some words&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mantras&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;repeating words, strongly associating them with
  some mental state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the old saying goes, "you can't believe everything you see in (the)
movies". Likewise, we have the more modern saying, "you can't believe
everything you read on the Internet".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These "common sense" statements reveal an often forgotten
truth. Things like books and films don't have to "obey reality" in the
same way that... we must respect gravity. People can say and show all
sorts of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media we consume, the verbal explanations we hear, and the mantras
we repeat contribute to our &lt;code&gt;verbal &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; emotional&lt;/code&gt; mapping.  This is
inescapable; insofar as you speak a language, words are going to
affect you. What we can control, however, is the inputs we consume to
inform our own mappings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Responding to "Hyperverbalism"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that is important to do "non-verbal activities". Here's some
examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instrumental music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workout/exercise (try &lt;em&gt;without music/podcasts/etc&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawing/painting (do visual arts; see shapes and stuff rather than
  trying to point out things you have words for like "eyes" and
  "mouth") &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programing (think &lt;em&gt;in the programing language&lt;/em&gt; as opposed to English
  or whatever language you default to) &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with being "hyperverbal" is that you are easily controlled
because the use of such-and-such trigger words gives pretty consistent
emotional responses. Think of a person you know that is particularly
vulnerable to "it's not what you said, it's &lt;em&gt;how you said it&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practicing observing reality in ways that aren't mediated by words is
helpful to protect yourself from emotional manipulation and to also
see new things that the words you conceptualize the world with may
have previously concealed from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moar Media and Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some readings/videos that have influenced my thinking on
these topics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3s47-p9rE0"&gt;"Were the Ancients Morons? (Translation and
  Mindset)"&lt;/a&gt; (Luke Smith;
  January 29, 2019)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Right-Side-Brain-Definitive/dp/1585429201"&gt;*Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&lt;/a&gt; (Betty Edwards; 1979)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://royharrisonline.com/INP27.html"&gt;"On 'primitive' languages in linguistic theory"&lt;/a&gt; (Roy Harris; 2010)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linguist Roy Harris on monolingual dictionaries; don't have specific references now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N.T. Taleb has treated the topics discussed here; don't have specific references now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some Luke Smith video that talked specifically about people
who only "think in words", but I can't find it at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from President Trump using this term fairly recently; I'm
not sure what connotations this term carries&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the movie &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;; a constructed reality&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my childhood, I read the book &lt;em&gt;Drawing on the Right Side of
the Brain&lt;/em&gt; which had some exercises training me in this; I
wouldn't necessarily get excited about the LEFT/RIGHT brain
science localization bandwagon, but the exercises this book
presented were useful nonetheless&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the idea that languages like Python are easier because
they "read more like English" is nonsense because whenever you
learn something specialized/technical, you need to learn new
senses of words. Having programing language keywords in your
language (like &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;, etc) may be helpful at first to
remember the keyword itself, but soon after it really doesn't
matter since you have to learn the specialized/technical senses of
these words. In this way, I think that making "programing
languages in Chinese/Arabic/Hindi" etc. doesn't really matter. You
&lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; make alternative keywords or something, but I think most
people will want to default to ASCII keywords...&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

manage a café, you might have counts of how many coffees you sell each
day. This can help you answer questions such as &lt;em&gt;how many pounds of
coffee beans should be purchased each month?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff gets complicated, however, when people do stuff that people
do. For instance, getting free coffee refills. Suddenly, the
assumption of "one sold cup of coffee means one cup of (physical)
coffee" is broken because some blogger will park their butt in your
café and drink three cups of coffee over the course of two hours for
the price of one cup of coffee. In terms of how much coffee you must
order, this means for &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; customers, one cup of coffee sold means
&lt;em&gt;more than one cup of coffee's supply of coffee beans are required&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;sup id="fnref:0"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, I use a seemingly simple measure (number of
coffees sold) to illustrate that &lt;em&gt;counting stuff and interpreting
counts&lt;/em&gt; is seriously difficult business, especially if you are not
very familiar with the data involved. To be "data-driven" or
"fact-based" often means to wholeheartedly assume certain data sets
are as people report them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that being skeptical of how good some data is &lt;em&gt;does not entail
"conspiratorial thinking"&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;assuming some group of evil-scheming
people plotting a power grab or something to that effect. Data
collection can be bad because multiple well-intentioned actors follow
different procedures. Here we are looking at &lt;em&gt;the opposite of
conspiracy&lt;/em&gt; in the sense of jointly-coordinated efforts towards some
aim&amp;mdash;we are looking instead at messy data from different parties
failing to coordinate and the aggregation of data from different
(relatively independent) sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Viral Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we do have some pretty good info on how viruses operate and
spread generally. For instance, an (Internet) friend shared this
excellent, accessible article describing how a virus can spread and
what sorts of situations are high-risk: &lt;a href="https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them"&gt;"The Risks - Know Them -
Avoid
Them"&lt;/a&gt;
by Prof. Erin Bromage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the info in this article is solid. The author of
the piece above is an expert in these things. Articles like the one
above are helpful as "field guides" to understand how to best protect
our friends and family from viral threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's assume we have a decent &lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt; of how viruses generally do
some stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Authority and Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Bromage (from the above linked article) asserts &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always defer to the guidance from your local Health Department or
the CDC!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncertainty about the counts of COVID-19 matters leads me in no way
to contradict Prof. Bromage on questions of how viruses spread and
what we can do to protect one another. However, as an independent
individual (in the sense that I'm not a government official making
policy on COVID-19, a university professor who is obliged to honor
certain institutions), I have reasons to doubt how much the WHO or the
CDC or whoever knows about the (biological) reality of COVID-19
situation as it evolves. No need to open the geopolitics can of worms
here to make this point... &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big class of unknowns, as introduced in this article, is &lt;em&gt;what
exactly is being counted and how is it being counted&lt;/em&gt;. To me, it seems
&lt;em&gt;heterogeneous&lt;/em&gt;; we are seeing different ways of counting different
things from different places. This is no one individual's
fault&amp;mdash;but I think it is helpful to appreciate this fact rather
than reactively making policies that &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; affect many people's
lives drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own life, I have chosen to act (very) conservatively, pretty
much not going out at all over the past couple months. Should this be
ordered as a top down policy? I dunno, should we ban french fries and
tell people not to drive motorcycles?! This is a political issue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feelings and Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart people, such as Prof. Broman, seem to assume we have decent
enough data on what is going on to make &lt;em&gt;mandates&lt;/em&gt; on huge scale. We
are seeing a pretty big "civil disturbance" here; it is not "just the
flu bro" in terms of institutional/governmental responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are collectively making decisions in using rather opaque
data. Policies like YouTube's anti-disinformation campaign against
content opposing the World Health Organization's &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; statements on
COVID-19 make sense from a Chinese-style "social harmony"
perspective&amp;mdash;we want everybody to be "on the same page" working
together. Big organizations everywhere are making similar "get on the
(establishment-approved) bandwagon" type policies governing what
people are allowed to say, less they be thrown into the "conspiracy
theory" loony bin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us not confuse confident/assertive language for understanding!
We are living in times with more data readily available than ever, but
we have not collectively improved on how to filter or deal with all
that data. Statistics is a specialist's art (science? engineering
exercise?) and often those most knolwedgable about some model in the
world are most blind to see things in other terms &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is one way to get people to hop on board with a decision. This is
the "if we don't do anything that's the worst" type thinking. Will
this lead to the best outcome? Unfortunately, this is often the tool
used to steer collective decisions (e.g. voting in democracies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can expect exploitation of fear to fuel political agendas (which
may be ones we agree with) to continue as long as humans continue to
make societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this COVID-19 situation, I think that widespread fear is a
particularly big problem because we are seeing lots of
expansion/exercise of government power over all sorts of things: where
people can('t) go, who gets money, who is "essential", etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with fear itself; indeed it is a very useful
thing to make quick decisions (often without thinking) about stuff
like... &lt;em&gt;don't walk over some narrow crumbling bridge to take a selfie
or you might die&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;don't try to pick a fight with some dude who has
eight scary-looking friends around him&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trying to understand the situation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear, however, can be counter-productive to understanding. In the
above examples, fear may save my life but it also prevents me from
understanding &lt;em&gt;what I can do&lt;/em&gt;. I could stop and take a picture of that
scenic crumbling bridge, using a selfie-stick as a monopod thing to
get a better angle. I could observe the scary people from the shadows
and learn a bit more about the culture of the area I am in. When faced
with unknown situations, &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt; is a useful thing to feel. As
situations evolve/change, however, fear may wear away and we can begin
trying to understand things better...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some strategies I have for trying to understand what's going
on around me, broadly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect &lt;strong&gt;(primary) data&lt;/strong&gt; including &lt;strong&gt;first-hand accounts&lt;/strong&gt; of what
  is going on; aggregate measures are good for some things, but can be
  very misleading when readily accepted in some pre-packaged narrative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek out and &lt;strong&gt;compare alternative choices/decisions&lt;/strong&gt;; somebody else
  may have a different take on something&amp;mdash;investigate what
  assumptions they are making to lead them to believe this; don't
  assume someone is &lt;em&gt;irrational/idiotic&lt;/em&gt; because they arrive at
  different conclusions than you; instead follow their chain of
  rationalization to find their beliefs (which you may find yourself
  agreeing with)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognize we are making decisions under uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt; and realize
  that more certainty doesn't mean more understanding (think of your
  favorite "stupid zealot")&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools I use to do this are many. For example,
&lt;strong&gt;gossip/smalltalk/banter&lt;/strong&gt;
is a great way to find out about how people are thinking/feeling about
stuff generally. You could be a nerd and look at some aggregated poll
result (worse). Or, you could just listen to some different people
tell you stories and/or complain about stuff (better). This is primary
feelings data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intentionally &lt;strong&gt;stay subscribed to/read media from people very
unlike me&lt;/strong&gt; because I think they may bring up good ideas that I am not
intended to find myself. For instance, I lean towards less top-down
control and more "muh freedoms" (libertarian) in how I prefer the US
to be run. However, I can see in anime how glorious &lt;em&gt;nippon&lt;/em&gt; can be a
beautiful place with top-down directed castle building and government
sponsored giant robots. I personally wouldn't want to go through all
those Japanese formalities of bowing and saying this-and-that
phrase. But I recognize the aesthetic appeal of this and why Japanese
tourism is way more popular than me (at least pre-COVID-19, lol). I am
personally a cis-gendered straight male (type o blood, black hair,
brown eyes; very common). But I learned myself some basic gender
theory and SJW &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; talking points because they point out some big
social issues of our time. There is no point denying the hurt/pain of
people unlike me, even if I don't agree with their political aims for
the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can remind ourselves of how we can get involved with some
idea/cause or another. This is one reason I write stuff here. I can
look at what I've said and see a record of how I've said smart/dumb
stuff. By writing about how I think about things, I can get insight
into stuff I do(n't) see and guard against where I might be led
astray. For instance, I know that in the past, I've been a relatively
conflict-averse ("agreeable") person, often to my disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Declarations of Faith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning back to COVID-19 matters...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are witnessing an interplay of &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;faith&lt;/strong&gt; with regards
to how people are responding to COVID-19. My word salad above
explains some ways in which I try to better undersand what's going on,
and consequently, how I determine who/what to put my trust in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I see it, we are all "people of faith", just different folks put
faith in different stuff. In these trying times, we are seeing many
sorts of "prophets" rising up, each belonging to different "churches",
and some using social media more than others, ha! As this COVID-19
business unfolds, we'll see how the "prophecies" of these different
groups unfold. Until it is over, we'll see fear continuing to drive a
"witch hunt" against those without unwavering faith in "the
establishment", broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I think that &lt;em&gt;less escalation/application of state power&lt;/em&gt;
is best because individuals can choose to protect themselves and their
families in many ways, to the extent they perceive COVID-19 as a risk.
I don't think the evidence/analyses of what is going on are good
enough to warrant total, prolonged, widespread mandatory shutdowns of
lots of stuff, as we're seeing. Though, I do hope
businesses/governments/etc. give people options to stay
quarantined/locked-down if they wish to choose this more conservative
option...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...in any case, until locked down times end... more blog posts 🙃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:0"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A "nuance bro" informed me that there is &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; nuance to
be introduced to this scenario. Many coffee shops throw away extra
brewed coffee at regular intervals (2 hrs, 30 min...). Some of
this extra coffee may go into other products such as "iced
coffee", but in general, it goes down the drain. So refills may be
inconsequential... until you drink the whole coffee pot?
Hmm. Nuance. Bro.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

looking at how the tough-times of COVID-19 lock-in have weakened many
accountability mechanisms that keep many of us going day-to-day. Then,
I'll go into some strategies I've successfully used to keep myself
motivated and working hard. My goal here is to share some info I have
found useful and also to remind myself of things that have worked for
me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let the psychologizing and rationalization begin!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accountability: "Nagging" You Ask For&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accountability is kinda like... &lt;em&gt;nagging you ask for&lt;/em&gt;. That is, you
ask someone, some party, or some computer program to bring something
to your attention (such that you can use this information to make
better choices). In the moment, you may not &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to hear those
reminders, but you set up a system such that your past-self can help
your present-self make good choices for your future-self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, family members may agree to hold themselves accountable
for &lt;em&gt;doing meal preparation at the beginning of the week&lt;/em&gt; in order to
try to eat more whole foods and save money from not eating
out. Accountability means reminding the people involved to keep a
schedule, repeating reasons why such-and-such is a good idea, and of
course each individual agreeing to do what they said they would
do. More proactive accountability may include facilitating success in
the project by doing appropriate shopping, finding
inspirational/informative videos etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lock-in Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explored in &lt;a href="./corona-virus-diary-part-8.html"&gt;Part 8&lt;/a&gt; of this
series, many structured aspects of our "daily routines" are disturbed
by this lock-down business. Activities taken for granted like
&lt;em&gt;commuting to work/school&lt;/em&gt; are disturbed. Also interrupted are things
like &lt;em&gt;physical accountability of seeing familiar faces in classrooms
and workplaces&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many businesses and institutions have done a good job continuing to do
their "main service" (e.g. a school delivering cirriculum material, a
restaurant serving food). However, lock-in measures have meant that
many "secondary services" are interrupted. Many of these activities
are important mainly for accountability.  For instance, you don't
really "learn anything" about Calculus from the first five or ten
minutes or so of settling in class. However, this time is important
for many students to figure out "was I the only one confused about
question XYZ?" or "who here knows what is going on".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As activity gets reduced overall, we observe governments/corporations
making distinctions between "essential" and "non-essential"; what is
"essential" often coincide with the "main services" and what is
non-essential is the "extra-stuff", i.e. everything you miss out on
when you go to online class vs in person class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I see two related problems. First, there is (1) &lt;strong&gt;nerd-think&lt;/strong&gt;
that school is about data-transfer of knowledge, restaurants are about
food/nutrition, etc., and (2) &lt;strong&gt;technological obstruction of accountability&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-nerd think here is to say that restaurants aren't just about food,
they are about atmosphere, people gathering together, and so on and so
forth. School is not mainly about content-delivery, it is about
learning how other people work and how society functions.
Technologies like Zoom (video conferencing) impose different, often
more limited
&lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/language-and-linguistics/essays/channels.html"&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;
of communication on people in workplaces, students, etc. While these
channels are often adequate to convey the "primary" material of
lecture content, meeting agendas, and so forth, they are often much
poorer at encouraging accountability.  Furthermore, in these channels,
inequalities of access are magnified by students' differences in
computer hardware, technical know-how, and connection speeds &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we are witnessing is &lt;em&gt;a qualitatively different experience&lt;/em&gt; being
delivered to students, workers, etc., even if nominally "the products
are being delivered". As such, we must adapt our strategies to stay
motivated. Studying for online class is different from studying for
offline class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accountability as a Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strategy I've found helpful to stay motivated is to appreciate and
use &lt;em&gt;accountability as a service&lt;/em&gt;. By realizing how we are involved in
delivering accountability to others and asking others to give us
accountability, we can all work together to make the world a better
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locked-down times have reminded me that much of the value of
institutions of things like schools and offices is the &lt;em&gt;structure of
accountability&lt;/em&gt; it delivers, rather than the "knowledge" you get
there. Places where people gather are engines of social accountability
to keep people moving (and hopefully, learning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, one position I am working is as a teaching assistant at a
web programing bootcamp. One of the main functions of this bootcamp is
to help give students &lt;em&gt;structure in order to learn&lt;/em&gt;. Truly, you can
find all the content of the bootcamp for free online; this is open
source software stuff that you can learn about without paying a cent
using public library Internet. However, in addition to raw technical
know-how, bootcamp offers structure and accountability &lt;em&gt;as a service&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding my role as offering accountability as a service means
that I can redouble efforts towards broader common goals, rather that
over-optimizing specialist knowledge for narrow technical domains.
Leaving class with students feeling empowered and prepared to read
documenation and follow XYZ steps to solve some problem is a bigger
accomplishment than solving some problems &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; a few students and
having them leave class thinking "wow this is so complicated" or "alan
knows a lot of stuff".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My business-book instincts tell me that this sort of idea is
"leadership"; you want to offer vision and motivation to other people
to move forward so you don't have to do everything yourself. Of
course, there are many steps you must take to gain the trust of those
working with you, but ultimately, success is in having independent
actors working at solving problems you haven't even thought of yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these COVID-19 times it is more important than ever to engage
in accountability &lt;em&gt;networks&lt;/em&gt;, both giving and receiving social
incentives to keep stuff moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Competition and Care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of a topic jump here&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another type of accountability which we are mostly all
familiar with in some domain or another: &lt;strong&gt;competition&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition is very important because it means that you know at least
&lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; cares about what you are doing&amp;mdash;namely your rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people transition out of schooling, where there are things like
sports/grades/exams/popularity to have competitions with, the metrics
of competition become much more harder to discern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge I faced while being a graduate student was not really
having much competition in that I was focused on pretty esoteric
topics and didn't particularly need to "beat" anyone at anything
(maybe write a grant proposal that means some person subjectively
likes such and such better?). The accountability/motivation structure
of competition just wasn't there for me because I didn't really see a
point of me wanting to become "the best" in my field. Graduate school
grades don't work the same way as like... undergraduate math class.
I found myself enjoying taking undergraduate math classes because I
needed some quantitative validation. Trading stocks and bitcoin also
gave me some metrics to "compete" on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Re-introducing competition into your life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy I see for maintaining motivation during COVID-19 is to
ask &lt;em&gt;how much competition do I like to have?&lt;/em&gt; Then, if you do not have
enough competition, you should find some people to create some sort of
game/accountability with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a friend that shares a hobby; make a challenge to improve
  (e.g. memorize such and such Chopin piano piece; have a duel in 2
  weeks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climb your workplace power ladder; volunteer to take up some
  responsibility you have not had before, and take charge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a fixed plan for something you are trying to improve on:
  e.g. fitness goals, writing more, etc.; make it fun by agreeing to
  give someone 100 dollars or something if you mess up on some
  pre-defined terms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that people differ in terms of personality on how much
competition they like. Many people are pretty darn comfy with
virtually zero competiton, and that's fine.  Growing up, I was
"anti-competitive" in many ways: for instance, I enjoyed learning to
juggle and having fun with some circus skills rather than succeeding
in more mainstream sports &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Breaking out of this bubble after a
while though, I found that I really enjoyed competition especially
because it meant having more people to share experiences with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accountability is a powerful force. On one hand, &lt;em&gt;establishing&lt;/em&gt;
accountability is a powerful act of &lt;em&gt;self determination&lt;/em&gt; in which we
actively make plans for how we are going to live our lives better. On
the other hand, accountability is a contract in accepting controlled
unpleasantness (nagging, delaying gratification).  Accountability is
making plans of action to use the people, institutions, machines,
etc. around us &lt;em&gt;conspire&lt;/em&gt; for our success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we don't have accountability in our lives (either to ourselves or
to others), we may experience more unpleasantness in more unexpected
ways than we would like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating structures of accountability means making us motivated to
answer not just to ourselves, but also to the people around us. In
doing so, stuff becomes more fun and interesting and the not-so-fun
moments we experience are at least directly contributing towards some
productive end. This is the stuff living is made of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, I too can re-iterate leftist talking points!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? I think part of this was the fact that I could get some
  attention and stuff for just being "different" and enjoying
  something intrinsically kinda fun rather than diving into the
  bigger institutional opportunities available to me.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

times. Take a morning commute, for instance. Sitting in traffic on the
way to sit in a cubicle?! Now I repent; I find myself missing lots of
these things now that I'm staying in most every day, most all the
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this COVID-19 business has made me appreciate how having certain
discrete "events" in my day&amp;mdash;which at times may have seemed
annoying&amp;mdash;have acted as useful for anchor points for both
structuring my time and "keeping up" with various things I don't
typically directly concern myself with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, through riding my bicycle to class/study, I gained lots
of first-hand knowledge of on-going (societal) trends. I don't really
feel much of an intrinsic desire to keep up with pop culture. But,
going around town, I'd hear songs, see people with graphic T-shirts,
etc., which would inform me about what's buzzing. I'd see what kinds
of pets were popular, how Chinese vs Japanese vs Korean fashions
differed, what restaurants were popular... All sorts of observations
that contributed to understanding "what it is like" &lt;em&gt;to be&lt;/em&gt; in
such-and-such time and place happened during the "transition times" of
commuting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being in the &lt;em&gt;same world&lt;/em&gt; as others, we learn to relate with one
another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"The Routine" as Shared Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility of activities such as the morning commute do not become
apparent until they are gone. Lock-down times have taught me how
important many aspects of routine are in developing a sense of
connection with the people around me. We need &lt;em&gt;shared context&lt;/em&gt; with
those around us to understand each other; simple routine things like
&lt;em&gt;having to go to meetings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;commuting along XYZ freeway&lt;/em&gt; are
representative "lowest common denominator" ways in which we can relate
to one another &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through all this lock down stuff makes me reflect on &lt;em&gt;how very
different&lt;/em&gt; each of us is experiencing COVID-19. Aside from the
Internet, we lack a "common space" to meet one another&amp;mdash;in the
past decade or so of my life, this has been school/coffee
shops/restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Re-creating Shared Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these physically isolated times, it is in the shared spaces of
social media (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, games,
Discord, etc.)  that we establish norms and shared experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider it important that we have &lt;em&gt;individuals&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;not just
polished corporate accounts&amp;mdash;producing content. Meme
"shit-posting", status update ramblings, and rando-comments are all
things we can do to claim our place in "writing the narrative" of what
COVID-19 was like. Nobody is going to passively observe me walking
around town, because I'm parking my butt according to lock-down
directives. But somebody might scroll by a click-bait title I produce,
and in this sense, I enter the subconscious in the same way I would
walking down a street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only for the time being, the streets that we "walk" down are social
media feeds of various sorts. Until we can again freely walk the
streets, we stroll down the "public" boulevards of the Interwebs via
social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Lowest Common Denominator" means that it doesn't require
special knowledge, training, subtlety etc. to understand these
things. Generally accessible. Like Marvel movies or Boba tea.
Contrast with "acquired tastes" (such as differentiating varieties
of black coffee or kimchi; expertise on 19th century Russian
novels)&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

tides with respect to policy. As for the science/biology about what is
actually going on with COVID-19, I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As summer arrives in sunny California, we are seeing longer
days. Soon, people around the Northern hemisphere will be flipping on
their air conditioning units &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Maybe as the weather heats up,
people will become content with staying in (so long as finances are
taken care of)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some how, in some way, people are hanging on. Many have accepted
locked-in life as the "new normal". Others wait in anticipation for
&lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; to change and then automatically exploit any loopholes they
can to still be "well behaved" citizens &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hope of Risk Free Returns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few months, we've seen &lt;em&gt;a preference for security and
risk-free returns&lt;/em&gt;. That is, people would rather have a lock down and
keep things more "safe" rather than facing the dangerous unknown.
We're seeing a shift away from this as lock-down policies are wearing
people down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Guaranteed "Side Effects" to Avoid Possible "Main Effects"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I see happening is a general shift towards reacting to &lt;strong&gt;known
side-effects&lt;/strong&gt; (economic problems), away from responding to &lt;strong&gt;unknown
main effects&lt;/strong&gt; (the actual dangers of COVID-19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping work for a week or two is something &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; working people can
do, especially if they are still getting paid and/or can work
remotely. However, as companies have begun laying off more and more
employees (especially small businesses, who don't make enough money to
'weather the storm'), we are seeing more agitation to end lock-down
policies and "open up" society again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are feeling the real costs of lock-down. If you do things like
fasting and make doing nothing a sport (meditating), you are probably
OK during lock down. For those that don't have some kind of
"minimalism" as a hobby, times are tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to get everyone to shut up, behave, and honor essential
workers as heroes are getting tiresome as people find themselves
regulated into powerlessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding Your Own Risk Free Returns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own strategy approaching the challenges of lock-in is to look for
places where my own effort input has an effect. There are many realms
where there are basically risk-free returns, e.g. doing
pushups. Assuming you don't totally overdo it, the more pushups you
do, the more fit you will become &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having projects like (1) completing reading books, (2) working through
problems/exercises, (3) establishing regular contact with
friends/family members, (4) maintaining a garden, and (5) acquiring
proficiency in a foreign language, require continued application of
concentrated efforts. The remedy for feeling like you are doing
nothing is to &lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I know I will see is that once all this lock-down business is
over, I will emerge as a better person in many ways because I have
dedicated myself to some projects during these trying times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Warrior in Waiting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many jobs where making good use of time while &lt;em&gt;waiting&lt;/em&gt; is
what is most important. Firefighters and &lt;em&gt;samurai&lt;/em&gt; both do not
spend most of their time putting out fires and slicing up enemies,
respectively. Rather, most of their time is spent preparing and
training so when critical encounters do happen, they are well-poised
to respond with utmost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is our turn to live the &lt;em&gt;way of the warrior&lt;/em&gt; and use our time to
prepare. When lock down policies sufficiently loosen up, it will be
our turn again to apply for jobs, climb mountains, go on dates,
etc. Until then, we train like a hardworking &lt;em&gt;choo-choo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw recommendations for "online therapy" from viewing YouTube
in a logged out, relatively private browser so I'm assuming these
are general rather than targeted ads.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I have learned &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to flip on the AC from watching
&lt;em&gt;One Punch Man&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;uwu&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the &lt;em&gt;reasons behind why rules are made&lt;/em&gt;, not the fine
language used in them u bozos. Jesus taught Christians to look at
&lt;em&gt;the spirit&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;the letter&lt;/em&gt; of the law.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same cannot be said for practicing extreme sports, where

&lt;li&gt;analyze stuff to see why I was wrong and hopefully learn something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, I do a write-up here because it is more interesting
than being wish-washy and saying "it's complicated" without making any
concrete predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No "Universal Vaccination"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that we'll see a widely accepted vaccine being developed
in the next month or two. By the time something is developed, I think
that the main "scare" of COVID-19 will be past.  Already, we see many
places starting to open up &lt;em&gt;despite there being no vaccine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sub-claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things will continue opening up, regardless if there is a vaccine or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a vaccine is developed, stuff will likely already be sufficiently
  opened up that people will opt out of taking it unless forced to
  (e.g. by their employer, government mandate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall, I think more people will start getting flu shots and stuff
  after COVID-19, but institutional skepticism on a whole will
  likewise grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forced vaccination will be met with resistance from vocal
  minorities; in practice I think you can't force everyone to have a
  vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remote Work Will Grow, But Not Dramatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people got to "experiment" with remote work. Most people I have
talked with that have kept their jobs &lt;em&gt;don't like remote work&lt;/em&gt;. With
certain exceptions (e.g. computer programers), I think that
by-in-large, people will want to continue working in offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerds often think that other people have "rational" motivation
structures like them. They fail to see that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many (most?) people are strongly driven by external motivation,
  which can be negative (fear of punishment) or positive (praise,
  raises, etc.); traditional workplaces make it easier to deliver
  these incentives than remote work which puts a lot of
  technology-fiddling overhead on most involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people at some point declare "technological bankruptcy"; they
  simply decide they don't/can't use XYZ technology and stop learning
  more; learning new tech all the time is something nerds gravitate
  towards, but most people hate doing this and will resist change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote work &lt;em&gt;is costly&lt;/em&gt;; while paying rent for an office is
  expensive, wasting time dealing with people's failing microphones,
  noisy backgrounds, accidental screenshares, etc. wastes a lot of
  time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many jobs filled with people already well-prepared for remote work
will likely continue exploring/expanding remote operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think there will be a general trend for non-nerd work to
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; become more remote; many people have tried remote work and
decided &lt;em&gt;they don't like it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Establishment Will Survive (and Thrive)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many small businesses might get hit very hard, but the big players are
likely to sale through all of this stuff OK. Many tech stocks are
likely to do quite well, e.g. Amazon. I think that banks and oil will
also end up OK because of how tied up in government things they are;
the establishment is continuing the "too big to fail" thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that banks, companies, etc. will have rather lenient policies
for repaying loans and stuff &lt;em&gt;for the time being&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;meaning, we're not
going to see thugs from credit card companies knocking on people's
doors demanding money any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like college debt, I think that repayment stuff &lt;em&gt;will be
remembered&lt;/em&gt; by the establishment and there will be nothing like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_(biblical)"&gt;The
Jubilee&lt;/a&gt; given
to those hard hit by COVID-19, just temporary "good enough" relief to
prevent angry mobs with pitchforks and fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 stuff slowly wraps up, I think that people will emerge
with dramatically different conclusions. Many prepper/right-wing types
will emerge feeling vindicated for taking things into their own hands
and preparing supplies and stuff before all this virus business.
They&amp;mdash;along with many religious people&amp;mdash;will (correctly) see
that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Times of chaos can and will be used by governments to extend usual
  authority and implement new "temporary" policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Temporary" measures put in place during times of emergency may be
  used for all sorts of tricky stuff later (see 9-11, PATRIOT Act, and
  the expansion of the surveillance state)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many on the political left would like a more "maternal" state caring
  for (and controlling) the population in various ways, e.g. pushing
  solutions for how the nation &lt;em&gt;as a whole&lt;/em&gt; should evaluate and
  respond to risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, more left-leaning types will emerge feeling
vindicated by (correctly) seeing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their nations are ununified; struggles between different groups and
  partisan media that focuses on &lt;em&gt;differences&lt;/em&gt; rather than on how
  people are similar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many rejecting mainstream science (acting like "idiots" in their
  view); we will see many examples of more right-wing type people
  dying and stuff because they didn't listen to the establishment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A more urgent demand/need for healthcare reform (or &lt;em&gt;¡revolución!&lt;/em&gt;)
  in the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How capitalism as a sole operating principle doesn't solve
  everything (think: critique of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3164890827?book_show_action=false&amp;amp;from_review_page=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atlas
  Shrugged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  by Ayn Rand)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't expect to see much jumping from one side or the other of the
political spectrum. Left-leaning people will dig deeper into the need
for institutional solutions while more libertarian x right-leaning
people will want the establishment to
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=BTFO"&gt;BTFO&lt;/a&gt;.  Both
the left and right broadly (no, you &lt;em&gt;NUANCE BROS&lt;/em&gt;, I'm not going to
"resist the dichotomy") will be able to find validation for their
worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, all in all, I think the right-wingers will come out feeling a
lot better than the left-wingers overall. This is because the
left-wingers want institutional solutions to what they perceive as
problems, and COVID-19 (metaphorically) kicked the establishment in
the balls. The establishment is rolling around in pain a little bit
now &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Bernie Sanders is not the Dem party blessed
choice. Meanwhile, right wingers with their values in self-sufficiency
and building up families and communities (rather than exploring the
arts) instead of state power (okay, now I'm talking more about
&lt;strong&gt;libertarian&lt;/strong&gt; leaning right-wing types, not war-hawk hegemonic
theocratic types) will emerge from all of this feeling like had been
on the right track before all of this with their trucks, guns, and
gallons of water.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 5</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-5.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-04-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-04-24:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-5.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will describe how the delivery of information and

communication have changed during my life thus far, highlighting ways
in which current "high tech" ways of doing things have empowered small
groups of (technocratic) elites and the parties that pressure them to
push their (socio-political) agendas while undermining the well-being
of people who just want to build communities with their families
and friends while having some fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The evolution of information delivery pipelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a millennial (born in 1992), I recall a time when Internet access
was limited; it was a new and exciting "high tech" thing and having
access to computers was a kind of status symbol. Zoomers&amp;mdash;born
and raised surrounded by Internet connected technologies&amp;mdash;did not
experience the transaction from the "pre-Internet" world to the
"Digital Age" just as most millennials don't have the experiences that
lead many Boomers to become globalism embracing hippies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that overall, the expansion of the Internet (c.f. THE MATRIX)
has led to a much more &lt;strong&gt;fragile&lt;/strong&gt; world in the sense any one group's
decisions can have
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEA33bAXyNM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;hyuuuuuuuuuuuuuge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
consequences. Effectively, this means that propaganda is more
effective and faster acting. Like a machine gun versus a hunting
rifle. Frightening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The reach of news&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 20th century, people often got news through the "legacy media"
in forms like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newspapers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magazines (e.g. Time magazine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broadcast media (television, radio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These forms of "legacy media" are non-interactive in the sense that
they don't have something like &lt;em&gt;comments&lt;/em&gt; sections that give instant
feedback. You could call into a talk show or something, but
participating in things like this is not the default behavior of most
listeners&amp;mdash;most people
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lurk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lurk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
actively observe but not contribute content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, there was news everywhere even before my time&amp;mdash;for
instance in the 1980s, I imagine there were lots of TV broadcasts
running in corporate break rooms, dentists' offices certainly had lots
of magazines, super markets put tabloids near the front of the
store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, news media was not as &lt;em&gt;pushy&lt;/em&gt; as it is now on the
Internet. You could simply avert your gaze and look at something else;
nowadays, getting rid of news, advertisements, etc. often takes some
technical know-how and complex configuration&amp;mdash;it is not something
that can done instinctually with no training. The channels of
information in which news is delivered are required for daily (urban)
living: students must use web browsers to interact with their schools
and complete assignments, many companies are moving towards
electronic-only "paperwork", etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerd aside&lt;/strong&gt;: This trend has invaded even privacy + free information
concerned spaces.  A recent-ish annoying thing is that the Firefox web
browser pushed news stories onto their default home
page&amp;mdash;alienating nerds who had chosen firefox to avoid things
like this that happen on browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social interactions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News sitting in web browsers is non-threatening enough. But what about
wearing an advertisement on your forehead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much of what is being normalized in what I will call
&lt;strong&gt;corporate mediated communication&lt;/strong&gt;, using communications technology
(such as messenging apps) where corporate interests are pushed on the
user. This is perhaps the biggest problem I am seeing with information
technology today. One-on-one communication reaks of third party
intervention!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some context&amp;mdash;besides face to face conversations, the
pre-Internet channels for communication include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone calls (LAN line means ur mom could be eavesdropping)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Letters/postcards (relatively long form; you have to pay money to send)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other solutions, e.g. leaving notes on the refrigerator, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these media feel particularly "corporate". Sure, you probably
have to work with a company to get your phone line set up, but then
after that, you are largely left alone&amp;mdash;we'll assume nobody is
tapping your wire for now, ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so with smartphones/apps and most (desktop) online experiences!  I
leave Candy Crush installed in Windows 10 so that when I open the
Start menu, I can be reminded that I am in THE MATRIX. When you open
your (smart)phone, unless you flipped a bunch of options, you are
probably greeted by all sorts of news. Android pushes a lot of Google
news and stuff at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these things, if only for an instant, &lt;em&gt;colors our
conversations&lt;/em&gt;. Google/Apple/etc. seizes a bit of our attention before
we started chatting with our friends/family, listening to music, etc.
We may &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we aren't paying attention to these things, but the
headlines and stuff stick&amp;mdash;we get the sense that "the whole world
is doing XYZ"... ...big corporations are determining the contexts of
our conversations by setting mood lighting to their robo-desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Locked Down, Locked In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people are having fewer face-to-face conversations (because they
are not going out), more and more acts of communication
("conversations") are being carried out through corporate-mediated
communications technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevailing narratives such as "END OF WORLD", "TRUMP BAD", "CHINESE
VIRUS", etc. infect people's thinking as tech companies troll our
minds by constantly telling us &lt;em&gt;what to think about&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you open a tool box, your hammer may suggest hitting nails to you,
but that is about it. A piano sitting in your living room may suggest
"you should practice", but it doesn't say "think about XYZ; should we
do military intervention?!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made some conscious decisions about how I set up my tech, I am
relatively well off standing back and analyzing what's going on with
the news and stuff. But I don't expect this of most
people&amp;mdash;especially if they are busy doing important work like
saving people as medical workers or keeping our (already crumbling)
infrastructure from totally collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current attitude is to low-key hate smartphones specifically, but a
lot of the "information ecosystem" more broadly, and avoid invasive
technologies most of the time. Nonetheless, I recognize that these
technologies are ubiquitous things and that I can't get away with not
using one (at least until I have a family of my own, some land,
etc). I was born and raised in THE MATRIX and I must do my part to
help those still in it. So I am doing things like this... writing blog
posts to share my thoughts to hopefully help at least some people see
what is going on with information delivery and then make better
informed decisions about things rather than accept the terrible
"default settings" which we are naively handed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 4</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-4.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-24:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-4.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What do I do under quarantine lock-down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try something for a while, for instance solving some problem or
reading a chapter of a book. Sooner or later, it will become too
boring/difficult to continue. So, I'll switch to another activity that
I think I should be doing. Repeatedly cycling through different
activities I should be doing, I end up "clocking in" lots of time
doing productive stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workout (e.g. pushup sets, crunches)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foreign language study (e.g. read some news in Chinese, review some
  Spanish grammar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuss with some Linux config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse over the documentation for some programing language (mostly
  Node, Golang, bash these days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to solve some fussy CSS problem &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing blog posts (like this one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing some &lt;em&gt;Étude&lt;/em&gt; on some musical instrument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the individual activities above often is not the most fun
thing in the world to do. But the variety of being able to cycle
through them means lots of little sessions of intense focus. I lower
my expectations for myself by only expecting to concentrate for like
20 minutes at a time. Workout bursts are even shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sundown I'm usually adequately tired (or interested in something)
that I don't need to ask myself about what to do next. If I feel like
sleeping at 9 PM, sure, I'll go to sleep. If I wanna stay up reading
about how Arab Nationalism didn't work, sure I'll go do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcomed Interruptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punctuating the above routine with sending/receiving a message or two,
looking at the whatever noise I heard outside, flipping through some
book, etc. keeps me feeling "in the loop".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something something &lt;em&gt;flow like water&lt;/em&gt; uhh... zen... yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, it didn't taste excellent, but that's how stuff goes. Every
meal every time doesn't need to be excellent; sometimes we just have
better/worse ingredients available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cooking experience reminds me of something I am trying to do in
other domains of life. That is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Don't be a hipster"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;똑바로 해&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting comfortable with standard tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, there have been different &lt;em&gt;schools&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;styles&lt;/em&gt; of
cooking. Different regions of planet earth had different ingredients
available, different cultural taboos, etc. And so cuisines developed
around core ingredients and time-tested methods to make those
ingredients taste good, kill disease, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking is very daunting if you are always jumping around trying to
make this-and-that culture's ingredients. You may even find yourself
buying specialized tools for all sorts of specific tasks (e.g. a torch
thing for &lt;em&gt;Crème brûlée&lt;/em&gt;, a fancy wok for some South Chinese style
stir-fry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, it pays to learn some standard tools well in other
domains. Jumping around and chasing diversity ("spreading yourself too
thin") is &lt;em&gt;no bueno&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer&lt;/strong&gt;: lots of unix things; computer science fundamentals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt;: Look at common, well-regarded music. Don't get lost in
  equipment. Focus on core skills...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Languages&lt;/strong&gt;: standard usage; common colloquial stuff (don't go down
  rabbit hole of dialects and stuff unless you have a specific social
  reason to do so)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the "vanilla" defaults well gives you more freedom because you
can only make variations of the "default" when you &lt;em&gt;first know the
default&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literary Aside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What good are novels/movies/etc. flipping over narratives left and
right when the main audience no longer knows the default narrative?
The overly flipped narratives become the default narrative. And
suddenly the old dusty book has the edgy take.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 2</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-22:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reporting again from self-quarantine, your independent media 👋 Today

we are going to do some more armchair sociology and
psychologizing. Buckle up ("Click it or Ticket") and grab your
favorite face cover, things are about to get sneezy. Might even add
some abstractions and philosophy to the mix...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, let's define a term: &lt;strong&gt;belief&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regarding "Belief"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English, we have this word "believe" which is quite peculiar. It
has &lt;em&gt;strong religious connotations&lt;/em&gt;. Many would say the question of
whether or not someone is a Christian ultimately comes down to a
question of &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;. But what exactly does it mean to "believe"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to look at "belief" is to see it as a &lt;em&gt;publicly alignment&lt;/em&gt; to
some cause. That is, one goes out in public and makes some
assertion. They are bound to their word.  This way of looking at
belief makes a lot of sense because it has to deal with contracts and
stuff, which America has a lot of maybe mostly owing to British
origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at "belief" is to evaluate &lt;em&gt;what people do&lt;/em&gt; rather
than &lt;em&gt;what people say&lt;/em&gt;. Truly, if you believed your house was fire,
you would do something about it, wouldn't you? By this definition of
belief, we have to prove that we believe something by how we act. From
certain stated axioms, do your actions (rationally) follow? If not,
our actions reveal what we
&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually"&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now given two senses of the word "belief", I will proceed to
characterize the crises of belief currently befalling many of the
people of planet earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;State of Disbelief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of the senses of the word "belief" above, we see that we are
collectively in a &lt;strong&gt;state of disbelief&lt;/strong&gt;. You probably can see the pun
I am making with the word "state" too 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we see people making all sorts of assertions about
the state of the world, what's going on. Then we look at what people
are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person might be able to perfectly recite some &lt;strong&gt;ideology&lt;/strong&gt;, giving
the "right answers" by basic logic + mental algebra. But when that
ideology doesn't line up with reality, we see what that person really
&lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; in the second sense I gave above&amp;mdash;their actions
manifest where their real convictions lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such behavior is sometimes can be called "hypocrisy", but I often see
it as more of a struggle to reconcile a collapsing world view. Maybe
"managing cognitive dissonance" or something like that for many
people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Theory Shmeary!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everyone and their favorite non-profit is trying to push some
ideology, it is not surprising that people often hold many incoherent
"beliefs" when taken together as declarations of belief. One might at
one time utter the words,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open borders! No kids in cages!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed borders! Keep everyone safe, Drumpf is an overconfident idiot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free market! We need everyone to have goods/services no matter the cost!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government rationing of supplies! Planned economy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and this is because these statements are taken from disjoint
self-contained systems (though not necessarily so). One person can say
them all; we are not computers that blow up if there is some "logical
contradiction".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My analysis is that these things people say belong to the first sense
of &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;publically making known one's adherence to some
words. One might analyze this as a sort of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act"&gt;speect
act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Globalists x NeoLiberals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One class of people I see getting hit hard are the relatively
&lt;strong&gt;xenophilic&lt;/strong&gt; ("foreign-stuff loving") types. These folks often like
to celebrate how people/places/cultures that are not them are
great. Imagine learning some foreign language of a people/culture you
do not belong to (oh no, I see my reflection).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see many of these folks turning inward, displaying their true
colors. It is not about diversity and decentralization of power
(e.g. competing US, European Union, Chinese, Russian, Pan-Indic,
Islamic forces vying for power...), it is about issuing in a
"democratic world order" in which the world is a zoo of cultures to
visit with a German (not to be confused with &lt;em&gt;Nazi&lt;/em&gt;, mind you)
passport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they announce is that they embrace diversity, respect other
cultures, etc. What their actions show they &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; is that they
have all the right answers and that these things should be exported at
the point of a gun to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the astute can see through the ideological &lt;strong&gt;virtue
signalling&lt;/strong&gt; of people saying how tolerant, diversity embracing, blah
blah they are. Such behavior made sense to climb up corporate ladders
and stuff in the pre-COVID-19 world. But when institutions shut down
and do not intervene between reality, shit hits the fan with &lt;em&gt;no
intervening toilet paper&lt;/em&gt;. The horror!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Traditionalists vs Revolutionaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people really like ritual, and just do stuff just because. I'll
call them &lt;strong&gt;traditionalists&lt;/strong&gt;. They may tell you that they don't need
a reason for doing what they are doing, they just do.  Insofar as
these people are able to keep up their traditions, they seem pretty
chill through all this quarantine business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditionalist doesn't need to explain at every step. They act in
a way that has led to survival in the past. The traditionalist
&lt;em&gt;believes&lt;/em&gt; tradition will allow them to weather this storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let is call the opposite of traditionalist a
&lt;strong&gt;revolutionary&lt;/strong&gt;. Revolutionaries want to overturn tradition and
forge a new path forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, being a "revolutionary" in a left-wingy sense has become
quite... mainstream. So we see lots of self-proclaimed left wingers
doing things like voting for Joe Biden. Voting to &lt;em&gt;conserve the
establishment&lt;/em&gt;. Lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the idea of the "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority"&gt;silent
majority&lt;/a&gt;" makes sense
to me. We see people who make the gestures of "revolutionaries" at
times, campaigning for social justice and all. But in the end, they
are establishment mongers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's OK in my book; you don't choose everything about who you are,
including dispositions towards certain behvaiors. I hope your
"revolutionary" comrades do treat you alright though if you fall into
this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So... what's your point?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we see many mismatches between word and deed all around us
everyday. In a time of crisis, like with impending
&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/corona-chan"&gt;Corona&lt;em&gt;-chan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it is
evermore easy to see the "raw belief" of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not condemn widespread hypocrisy around me. Rather I observe a
struggle to resolve ideologies&amp;mdash;often fragmented and incomplete,
consisting of collected sayings (c.f. Confucian &lt;em&gt;Analects&lt;/em&gt;). People
are being tested for what they &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; believe in the sense that
they are being forced into action. Certain actions reveal a mismatch
between proclaimed ideology and assessment of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think it is important to not get too fixated on witch
hunting based on proclaimed ideology because many people around the
world just proclaim what they do to stay alive. Much of China says
"yes communism!" because they didn't want to die; now they are acting
in a very much "yes fascism!" way in the sense that we see a marriage
of government and industry... PUNCH ALL CHINESE BECAUSE THEY ARE
FACISTS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bruh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other languages aside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other languages have lots of words (and even grammatical structure) to
discuss all things &lt;strong&gt;epistemological&lt;/strong&gt; (having to do with what
&lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; and what is &lt;em&gt;knowable&lt;/em&gt;, see
&lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology/"&gt;SPE&lt;/a&gt; for more
info).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish has a word &lt;em&gt;confiar&lt;/em&gt; which might sometimes be used in contexts
similar to "believe". But this word is also often translated as things
like "trust" (as in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; in the process&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The East Asian languages have translations from missionaries of words
in the Bible dealing with belief. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry><entry><title>Corona Virus Diary, Part 1</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-20:/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In contemporary times, Japanese people are famous being good at

waiting in lines and otherwise maximizing social cohesion. So when I
heard that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/5huKA_11/status/1237687423687155713"&gt;Japan was running out of toilet
paper&lt;/a&gt; and
that there were issues with people hoarding and buying out stores, I
knew that there was going to be trouble. Although my inner-prepper had
already led me to prep with things like things canned foods,
fire-starting devices, and knives (for cooking and chopping up
plants), it became clear to me that preparing more couldn't hurt. So
while stuff was still in stock, I went out and bought some more
essentials. At this point in the virus explosion timeline, everything
in the US was running as usual. COVID-19 (then sometimes called "Wuhan
Virus") &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; in the mainstream news, but businesses were still open
and running as usual. I think the stock market took some little dips,
but nothing major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom ahead a few weeks, and we see major market crashing action, Joe
Biden leading the Democrats, and some areas of the world (e.g. Italy)
hit very hard. Optimists say to expect maybe three more weeks of this,
but the inner &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doomer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doomer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
within each of us knows to expect more chaos for longer than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not too long ago finished filing taxes, so I didn't go sell off
all my stocks. I didn't wanna think about markets, government
intervention, and everything in between. Then the Federal Reserve
money printers started whirring. &lt;em&gt;brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Invisible Enemies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the news through all of this has been a bullshit filtering
exercise of great proportion. The scientifically minded are a bit more
comfortable with just &lt;em&gt;how little we know&lt;/em&gt;, but this is not the case
for the public at large. People turn every which way for
&lt;em&gt;authority&lt;/em&gt;. Some turn to popular personalities, others to
governments, and yet others to corporate e-mail announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one common thread that I see running through all these
reactions.  In the words of President Donald Trump, we're fighting an
&lt;strong&gt;"invisible enemy"&lt;/strong&gt;. Each person has constructed a different "invisible
enemy", though none can deny the chaos befalling our dear globalist
order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Containment Measures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you like... can't see a virus with the naked eye. So in a
very literal sense, we are fighting an "invisible enemy" since we
can't see viruses. I hope you are doing your part to not be part of
the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This "invisible enemy" does not immediately manifest itself. Even
breathing the same air as a healthy looking person can potentially
mean infection. The orders to practice &lt;strong&gt;"social distancing"&lt;/strong&gt; thus
urge people to not just avoid overtly coughting and weezing humans
around them, but to generally avoid breathing the same air as others
since we &lt;em&gt;don't know who may be infected&lt;/em&gt;. This is how we try to
contain the spread of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mostly-remote web developer, practicing "social distancing"
hasn't been much of a change for me in terms of day-to-day
lifestyle. However, as businesses continue closing their doors and
governments have begun issuing "shelter in place" orders, even my
already rather isolated remote life is being affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not yet know anyone personally who is infected with the virus,
though I expect I probably will in the near future. I plan to consider
taking quarantine stuff seriously. In terms of &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; goals (as
opposed to &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; goals like avoiding sickness and death) I intend
to do more pushups, squats, and crunches on the dungeon floor as well
as skipping rope in the corner of my yard. Current hobbies continue to
be studying foreign languages, doing computer nerd stuff, and
occasionally trying to make pleasant sounds on musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing for young-ish healthy people to do, I think, is to
&lt;em&gt;respect the enemy (virus)&lt;/em&gt; and to not "YOLO, whatever I'm traveling
to Italy!". This is mainly out of concern for others, though it may
very likely be a life-saving alignment for oneself. Those who have the
power to not end up in the hospital should choose to not end up in the
hospital so that those that need help can get it. Plus, it is no fun
to go to the hospital, but I didn't have to tell you that probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fanning the flames of ethnic tensions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mainstream media's response to COVID-19 has also done much to fan
the flames of existing tensions. I see my ethnic demographic
(&lt;strong&gt;Asian-Americans&lt;/strong&gt;) getting worked up against (white) people who do
not xenophilically embrace them. Certainly, hostilities exist between
different people groups. Just listen to a second-generation
Chinese-American immigrant mother describe how dirty white people are
for leaving their shoes on in homes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet we (Asian-Americans) are programmed to see micro-aggression in any
vanilla colored smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As COVID-19 rages, we see individuals &lt;em&gt;returning to ethnic enclaves&lt;/em&gt;
(oftentimes families where near everyone is of the same ethnicity). I
don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. But it is worth pointing
out that in times of trial people tend to reveal where their loyalties
really lie. Narratives of persecution &lt;em&gt;have not helped Americans
towards further solidarity with one another&lt;/em&gt;. Rather, they have
encouraged people to dig deeper into their
Semitic/Chinese/Indian/etc. tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also see people withdrawing into philosophical/intellectual (rather
than ethnic) camps. Groups of people united by something like a common
profession (e.g. programers) or a shared ideology (e.g. "secular
humanists") band may be able to survive together, at least for one
generation. However I believe that in the long run, ethnic and/or
religious affiliations are a more robust strategy, because
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neckbeard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;neckbeards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
cannot give birth to new generations with other neckbeards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Religion Rising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing institutional incomeptence, religion is looking healthier
overall from what I can see. People want to see other people and
communities. They would rather pray to God than see what demonic
bargains the governments of the world have to offer them next. The
promise of liberalism and globalism seems less appealing, even if the
Kingdom of Heaven cannot be known except through faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Online social lyfe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these tough times, we must recognize our nature as a "social
species" (though I think individuals differ drastically on how much
social contact they want).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm around if you contact me on FB, LINE, Kakao, or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more "public" like experience, I've been very impressed with
Discord. Come hang out with me and others on the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/2RFwR7R"&gt;Xah Lee
Discord&lt;/a&gt; server to meet interesting people
from all over the world and talk about anything under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes to self&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole boatload (non-infected, I hope) of topics to discuss
relating to all this coronavirus stuff. Here I list some things I want
to discuss further in the future. Feel free to reach out and suggest
ideas if you would like to see a discussion on anything...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antifragile&lt;/em&gt; (N.N. Taleb) and why none of the "collapse" we are
  witnessing is surprising at all.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the Internet and signal vs noise; bullshit filtering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;about Internet communications, generally &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First are some impressions/observations:&lt;/p&gt;

necessarily opposed to Yang, but was by no means an ardent supporter
either. Here's I share some thoughts about Yang's political
messages/campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First are some impressions/observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yang campaigned hard on &lt;strong&gt;Universal Basic Income&lt;/strong&gt;, $1000 bucks a
  month for pretty much all adults in a certain age range&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I accept Yang's point that this is probably a better
  redistribution scheme than other existing programs, layers and
  layers of bureaucracy, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would not like to see the government expand; it is unclear to
  me if Yang's Freedom Divident (aka &lt;strong&gt;NEET bux&lt;/strong&gt;) would be
  accompanied by cutting government spending elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If UBI were to come to be, I'd expect a proliferation of
  subsisting people living ant-style (&lt;em&gt;ari-zoku&lt;/em&gt;) for free; talk
  about danger for epidemics! A specialized class of rent-farmers
  would likely thrive too... (speculation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yang's race/ethnicity is a whatever to me&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But I see you racialists out there choosing Yang just because
  he's "of color" or "Asian" just like people chose Obama for
  similar reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think that there are both people more inclined to vote for
  Yang &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; he's Asian, and also people who would choose not
  to because of that... ...or maybe it's more about him appealing
  to the "nerd" demographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk of the threat of Artificial Intelligence and climate change
  without talk about populations/demographics gets the noggin' joggin'&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should governments decide which groups to subsidize (and
  hence increase) at the expense of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Insert Leftist critiques of big oil, tobacco industries, and
  related topics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yang appears to me to be a pretty good guy, and a sincere person. In
this way, I think he has a trustworthy "feel" like Sanders. However, I
do believe his policies in general would drive America to be worse and
worse; sorry Ayn Rand brainwashed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dichotomous Political Opinions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;, I like how Yang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criticizes the inefficiency of government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has a scheme to allow capitalism, but with some safety net&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see how people relate UBI to "classical liberal" thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rouses &lt;strong&gt;swamp-drainy&lt;/strong&gt; thoughts and criticisms of the &lt;strong&gt;legacy
   media&lt;/strong&gt; on the Dem side (search term &lt;strong&gt;yang media blackout&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;left&lt;/strong&gt;, I like how Yang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a redistributionist scheme that &lt;em&gt;is more universal than
   anything we've seen before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems relatively peaceful, not war-hawky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open the Third Eye; Optics and Meta-Cognitive Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike the 'MATH' campaign thing and all that nerd stuff; I see
that Yang is a lawyer too, not an engineer or even a veteran
(C.f. Tulsi Gabbard) so I suspect how "in touch" with reality he is on
the physics of the world. Math is wallowing in abstractions; how does
this map to reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't matter to most people who just clamour against "CLIMATE
CHANGE" and view they have "SCIENCE" on their side without
understanding a thing about it, besides what they've heard, akin to
how most people accept the traditions/religions handed to them.
(&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm not denying climate change or criticizing
traditions/religions here, I'm just making a point about how people
accept/reject ideas presented to them...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The memes were with him...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(...but many were probably by top-down design)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I hope that this whole Yang ordeal encoruages people to
criticially evaluate the sources they get any information from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I cite nothing and just say my impressions. No fake
news here. Just opinions. Is your news just opinions too?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="News"></category></entry></feed>
