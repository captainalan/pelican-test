necessarily opposed to Yang, but was by no means an ardent supporter
either. Here's I share some thoughts about Yang's political
messages/campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First are some impressions/observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yang campaigned hard on &lt;strong&gt;Universal Basic Income&lt;/strong&gt;, $1000 bucks a
  month for pretty much all adults in a certain age range&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I accept Yang's point that this is probably a better
  redistribution scheme than other existing programs, layers and
  layers of bureaucracy, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would not like to see the government expand; it is unclear to
  me if Yang's Freedom Divident (aka &lt;strong&gt;NEET bux&lt;/strong&gt;) would be
  accompanied by cutting government spending elsewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If UBI were to come to be, I'd expect a proliferation of
  subsisting people living ant-style (&lt;em&gt;ari-zoku&lt;/em&gt;) for free; talk
  about danger for epidemics! A specialized class of rent-farmers
  would likely thrive too... (speculation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yang's race/ethnicity is a whatever to me&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But I see you racialists out there choosing Yang just because
  he's "of color" or "Asian" just like people chose Obama for
  similar reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think that there are both people more inclined to vote for
  Yang &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; he's Asian, and also people who would choose not
  to because of that... ...or maybe it's more about him appealing
  to the "nerd" demographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk of the threat of Artificial Intelligence and climate change
  without talk about populations/demographics gets the noggin' joggin'&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should governments decide which groups to subsidize (and
  hence increase) at the expense of others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Insert Leftist critiques of big oil, tobacco industries, and
  related topics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yang appears to me to be a pretty good guy, and a sincere person. In
this way, I think he has a trustworthy "feel" like Sanders. However, I
do believe his policies in general would drive America to be worse and
worse; sorry Ayn Rand brainwashed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dichotomous Political Opinions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;right&lt;/strong&gt;, I like how Yang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;criticizes the inefficiency of government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has a scheme to allow capitalism, but with some safety net&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see how people relate UBI to "classical liberal" thought&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rouses &lt;strong&gt;swamp-drainy&lt;/strong&gt; thoughts and criticisms of the &lt;strong&gt;legacy
   media&lt;/strong&gt; on the Dem side (search term &lt;strong&gt;yang media blackout&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;left&lt;/strong&gt;, I like how Yang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a redistributionist scheme that &lt;em&gt;is more universal than
   anything we've seen before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems relatively peaceful, not war-hawky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Open the Third Eye; Optics and Meta-Cognitive Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike the 'MATH' campaign thing and all that nerd stuff; I see
that Yang is a lawyer too, not an engineer or even a veteran
(C.f. Tulsi Gabbard) so I suspect how "in touch" with reality he is on
the physics of the world. Math is wallowing in abstractions; how does
this map to reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't matter to most people who just clamour against "CLIMATE
CHANGE" and view they have "SCIENCE" on their side without
understanding a thing about it, besides what they've heard, akin to
how most people accept the traditions/religions handed to them.
(&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm not denying climate change or criticizing
traditions/religions here, I'm just making a point about how people
accept/reject ideas presented to them...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The memes were with him...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(...but many were probably by top-down design)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I hope that this whole Yang ordeal encoruages people to
criticially evaluate the sources they get any information from.&lt;/p&gt;
