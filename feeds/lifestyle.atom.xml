to do things. The same goes for the interfaces of many video
games. There is a single way to do things like change settings,
enter/exit the application, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be said for many desktop/laptop computers. For
instance, to install programs on MS Windows or Mac OS, many users just
(manually) go download some installer file and install things. Other
users will make use of Microsoft/Apple's official stores to get their
apps. Finally, some users (usually programmers, developers) make use of 
&lt;strong&gt;package managers&lt;/strong&gt; to do this job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different paths a user may take to do something like "install a
program" represent different approaches to computing, generally. For
instance, we might use some words to embody the three approaches for
installing listed above as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Lemme get what I need to do"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Make it easy and make it feel official, please"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Tedious things should be automated"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user of official app stores (2) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I do these days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours, I boot up Linux (see my &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html"&gt;Arch Linux install
guide&lt;/a&gt;),
launch emacs (see my &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/captainalan/d2d94f8ff88ba0c74e85560246d51fdf"&gt;config
file&lt;/a&gt;,
and proceed to write code, prose, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Chairs suck.</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-07-20:/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I personally dislike using chairs most of the time.

&lt;p&gt;Did you know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many centuries, chairs were "a symbolic article of state and
  dignity rather than an article for ordinary use" (Wikipedia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The earliest images of chairs in China are from the sixth century,
  but even then sitting in chairs was rare (Wikipedia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing, multi-story buildings, paper money, and examinations all
    have a longer history than chairs in China!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chairs became mainstream in the West and spread especially fast
  during the time of the "Industrial Revolution" (Chair Institute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty floors vs clean feet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairs are useful if you are wearing shoes, don't plan on taking them
off, and want to sit down. Note that it is nice to sit down on a bench
or chair to remove your footwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairs are not so good if you want to sit on a rug or reach things
that are close to the floor. Removing sandals or slippers requires to
chairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hot idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many common clothing items we wear were designed for purposes quite
unlike modern living. For example, long pants came from
horse-riding. Few people these days ride horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I live (California), it is usually rather hot. Rather than
following dressing, eating, and sleeping habits of other hot climate
people, many (most?) Californians like to retreat to air conditioned
coffee shops and dress and act like they live in cooler European
(English/German/French?) places. Why?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good uses of chairs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being required for being socially acceptable in a good many
places, there are a number of situations in which having a chair is
useful. To play the piano, for instance, it makes sense to sit on a
comfortably adjusted piano bench so you can reach the pedals under the
piano.&lt;/p&gt;
