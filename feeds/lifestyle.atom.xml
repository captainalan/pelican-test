money&amp;mdash;evidently, there are many people in this world who have a
lot of money through no application of effort on their own
part&amp;mdash;e.g. getting money through inheritance, winning the
lottery, or having profited from some form of speculation or
investment. &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of the nature of "work" is an important question to answer
because if work is something beneficial to us that we should be
doing most days of the year, it is good to know what this means so
that we can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern times, many of us have been quite detached from
understanding the nature of our work, who we are working for, and to
what ends we are doing work. Oftentimes "debates" about work are cast
in terms of false dialectics&amp;mdash;e.g. being &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;anti&lt;/em&gt;
technology. We need to move beyond that level of discussion&amp;mdash;the
presence of certain technologies is a fact of reality. That being
said, in the areas we do have a say in what is going on, we can seek
to be wise in determining where and when to introduce new technologies
versus where the latest fancy thing doesn't add any improvement and
may undermine the most important aspects of our business&amp;mdash;how it
brings together people in mutually beneficial ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this essay to think through what it means for me to use
my time in a prudent way and also to share whatever insight I might
have so that you my readers too may use your time better. The hope is
that we better understand how to &lt;em&gt;work together&lt;/em&gt; in this respect. By
more clearly characterizing what it means &lt;em&gt;to work&lt;/em&gt; I aim to be able
to better able to apply my own efforts to get things done in the world
and establish meaningful connections with those around
me&amp;mdash;whether in my physical vicinity or through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I'll describe some types of work people do as well as providing
some commentary on the modern manifestations of these roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obviously work-like type of work is "manual" or "physical"
labor. You can recognize this sort of work without much difficulty;
often it will involve a lot of repetition. Raking leaves, laying
bricks, and transporting items all fall under this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even people who mainly do "intellectual labors" (which I'll discuss
further on below) can benefit greatly from doing physical work. I
think this is one reason why you get a lot of people who are
professionals in white collar fields taking up a "hobby" like
carpentry or gardening&amp;mdash;there is something that cannot be
replaced in directly working with materials using our hands and simple
tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current age, most people have the idea that it is good to "get
exercise"&amp;mdash;do physically exerting movements to become stronger,
maintain fitness, etc. We've kinda cleaved work between the actions of
sitting at a desk for many hours a day and then getting ourselves to
"work out". While "working out" is built into physical labor like
chopping firewood, the modern person must choose to seek out physical
exertion, otherwise weakness sets in. This takes discipline. Insofar
as the above actions contribute to making a healthy body/mind, I would
call working out a kind of manual labor or training. Training a
healthy body lends to an effective, alert mind. This being said, it is
important for the white collar office worker to view physical fitness
as something &lt;strong&gt;essential&lt;/strong&gt; to work&amp;mdash;arranging pencils and
paperclips on a desk all day isn't work (it is idling); the least you
can do is be a physically fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also include being a &lt;strong&gt;messenger&lt;/strong&gt; in various capacities under this
sort of manual work. You can think of how in older times, you might
literally have a runner who carries a tablet from one location to
another in order to share some important information. Nowadays, we
likewise often have to do the work of relaying messages&amp;mdash;this
could mean sharing links, posting on a bulletin board, etc. Note, this
is not to suggest that that going on Reddit or Discord counts as
"working hard"&amp;mdash;rather I am making the point that it does take
effort/application of will to decide to be the vehicle by which
messages travel. Naturally, you should ask yourself &lt;em&gt;whose&lt;/em&gt; messages
you are sending and for what purpose...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Managers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job of a &lt;strong&gt;manager&lt;/strong&gt; is to organize workers. If a manager
understands the nature of the work of the workers this is better
because then the manager won't try to make useless/impossible/etc
demands. Lots of programers will complain about project managers who
tell them to do things which are very difficult to implement (and
hence time consuming and expensive)&amp;mdash;a skilled manager
understands the nature of demands placed upon workers and can allocate
time and resources appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenges managers face include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logistics&amp;mdash;having the right stuff in the right place at the
  right time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolving disputes with or among workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring workers and ensuring they get paid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, this general "manager" type might be called by many names.
We have layers of management in larger organizations&amp;mdash;a company
may have a CEO above &lt;em&gt;middle managers&lt;/em&gt; who in turn supervise workers,
for instance. "Human Resources" (HR) people might be called managers
who specialize in the hiring/paying of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a day to day basis, we all have to do a little "self-management".
That is, a properly managed person has a &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; for what they need to
do and when they need to do it. It more traditional societies, this
management was often done for people, but in our more "free societies"
where there isn't much of a default routine given to many people, it
is necessary for us to manage our time and resources to make sure the
things we want to get done do get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtypes of managers include property managers, estate managers, and
(software) project managers. The essential feature uniting all of
these groups is that they organizing &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; work is to be done though
they might not be directly involved in the "actual" work the of
putting the hammer to the nail. That being said, managers and managing
isn't bad/evil&amp;mdash;without the oversight of managers, the scope of
complexity of projects is severely limited. Good management means that
larger scale projects can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in modern times, when machines can replace a lot of the
sorts of work people may have done (e.g. software relays a message
where a person may have previously done this), each of us takes on
more responsibilities as a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Merchants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merchants&lt;/strong&gt; buy and sell stuff. They're important for &lt;em&gt;liquidity&lt;/em&gt; of
assets&amp;mdash;that is, being able to exchange things for money, the
generic medium of exchange. Merchants can support themselves if they
are skilled at buying at lower prices and selling at higher prices as
well as by employment under managers, who may use merchants to buy and
sell stuff for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders are kinds of merchants, but they often go between businesses
rather than being directly "customer facing". Shopkeepers are kinds of
merchants and may have to deal with many issues like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;theft, fraud, security, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;managing inventory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with different weights, measures, and media of exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Artisans/Craftsmen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merchants often sell items created by &lt;strong&gt;artisans/craftsmen&lt;/strong&gt;. Artists
and craftsmen are similar to workers, but might be called more
&lt;em&gt;skilled&lt;/em&gt; in that their crafts can't just be done by any able-bodied
person&amp;mdash;time and dedication must be put into study and learning.
I consider jobs like video editing, computer programing, and
traditional crafts like painting, woodworking, tailoring and so forth
to fall under this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have heard a self-styled communist talk about seizing the
"means of production". For craftsmen, this means being able to own the
tools to do work. Companies like Adobe exploit starving artists by
requiring these artists to &lt;em&gt;rent&lt;/em&gt; products like Photoshop through a
subscription type model. Thus, the digital artist can't own/control
their tools. Sometimes, artists work for large companies that have
&lt;em&gt;corporate licenses&lt;/em&gt; such that away from their company,
artisans/craftsmen cannot even use the tools they work with for their
own purposes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Judges, Lawyers, and Regulators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the category of the judges, lawyers, and
regulators&amp;mdash;these people establish and enforce the rules by which
all the other groups operate. Included here, one might put
politicians, lobbyists, and other occupations that involve
talking/writing to order society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roles don't provide "goods" or "services" in the sense that
everybody is under their jurisdiction, so they don't need to appeal to
customers. But examining evidence, making decisions, and so forth can
take a lot of time and energy, so I think these occupations do count
as "work" in sofar as evidence is being examined, good decisions are
sought...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knowledge/Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do certain sorts of work, it is necessary to learn/study
to know how certain systems are put together or to know some set of
steps to take. When getting started doing something like cooking, for
instance, a cookbook or instructional video/article "teaches" you in
that it enumerates what steps need to be taken to succeed in an
job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different sorts of jobs will have different requirements. Engineering
fields, for instance, require a lot of specialized training&amp;mdash;you
can't just read a recipe and successfully troubleshoot an engineering
problem. However, complex systems are often designed to be
&lt;em&gt;compartmentalized&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;there are some services you can do to "fix"
your car (e.g. pump up tires) for which you don't really need any
specialized knowledge for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more general things to learn&amp;mdash;I think you might call
this &lt;em&gt;wisdom&lt;/em&gt;. Then there are the specifics of how things in the world
work, which I will call &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. Wisdom is the same from age to
age, though specific knowledge, models, and tools will differ from
industry to industry. It follows that wisdom is helpful to possess in
any situation&amp;mdash;this can then be used to discern what sorts of
knowledge is useful/profitable in a given situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computers and Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, I discussed a bunch of different types of work as well as what
it means to learn/study, which is often a prerequisite for doing work.
I will now move into discussing what exactly &lt;strong&gt;computers&lt;/strong&gt; are, what
all of this "Aritifical Intelligence" buzz is about, and why we
should(n't) be afraid of "being replaced by machines".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we have people attempting to use computer systems to replace
both managers and workers. Robots/mechanical machines are the "lowest"
level here with "Artificial Intelligence" decision making at the "top".
"Platforms" take the place of storefronts as &lt;em&gt;e-commerce&lt;/em&gt; blooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that one of the main effects of the development of IT
infrastructue is the &lt;em&gt;centralization&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;consolidation&lt;/em&gt; of a lot of
control as well as the "atomization" of individuals and the tighter of
&lt;strong&gt;institutional coupling&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;you are more reliant on a central
system (i.e. the Internet) to do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People wouldn't change over to this system if there weren't &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;
enticing offerings. The Internet does make many sorts of actions
easier. Perhaps what is most tricky to deal with, I think, is this
general problem of &lt;em&gt;filtering&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ranking&lt;/em&gt; that we have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explored in other blog posts, people outsource lots of their
thinking and decision making to search engines. Large corporations
like Google therefore get to decide what sorts of things we see first,
what we take as mainstream/normal, and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we call "Artificial Intelligence" is often nothing more than
handing over decision making to non-personal parties. Now, we're
seeing the "driverless car revolution"&amp;mdash;this means turning over
transportation/traveling to big corporations like many people have
decided to put our trust in "fact checkers" to interpret the sea of
information on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, lots of these new technologies don't &lt;em&gt;solve new problems&lt;/em&gt;;
even the automobile didn't "solve" a problem that horse/buggies didn't
already do&amp;mdash;rather, we saw a transformation of the types of work
people were doing to be more tightly coupled to an industrial
system&amp;mdash;in the case of automobiles, the roads and highways and
the cities that rely on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis I offer in this essay can be used to clarify how exactly
AI technologies are being used to replace human participation in the
world&amp;mdash;as I see it, this is mainly in the field of "decision
making". But this is only possible to do after the road is paved
through standardization and subsequently setting up things to be more
mechanical and less human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contrasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the definitions of what work &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; and some forms it can take, we
can look at what is not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the state of being a "couch potato"&amp;mdash;this usually means
reclining on a couch and passively watching TV/movies/etc. &lt;em&gt;Reclining&lt;/em&gt;
rather than being &lt;em&gt;upright&lt;/em&gt; is associated with not working. Often this
is done with snacking or inattentive eating of some sort. The couch
potato indulges various &lt;strong&gt;passions&lt;/strong&gt; and does so &lt;em&gt;passively&lt;/em&gt;; rather
than &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; laboring to improve, the couch potato does what is
&lt;em&gt;easiest&lt;/em&gt;. This sort of (lack of) activity doesn't even involve
reaching out, engaging other people, and opening up oneself to
rejection, verbal abuse, etc. The couch potato chooses the &lt;em&gt;path of
least resistance&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;doing that which pretty much has no chance of
"failure". The plan is to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Idle talk" is not work. While it takes discipline, care, and
attention to speak succinctly in a forthright matter, to talk just for
the sake of talking or distracting oneself or others is not working
and can get you in trouble. I'm guilty of lots of speculation and
writing just to write, even here in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes for 2021 and Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter a new year, we see how work continues to be affected by
the ongoing COVID stuff. Many, many people are under or unemployed.
What is to be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that there is a difference between how
many dollars a person has and how much/hard they work. In some areas,
such as developing physical fitness or manual labor, there is a more
direct correlation between care/effort put in and results&amp;mdash;even
still work eventually is "undone" through aging and eventually death.
Likewise, we don't take money down to the grave. That being said, work
can be a very good and helpful thing to us all for building
disciplined, keeping focused, and avoiding &lt;em&gt;idle hands&lt;/em&gt; which may lead
us to bad places. Conversely, many people who landed comfy jobs,
inherited money, bought bitcoin at the right time, or otherwise &lt;em&gt;don't
have to work&lt;/em&gt; in order to "get by"&amp;mdash;it is is important for those
in this camp to not waste time idling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should likewise be "frugal" (not &lt;em&gt;miserly&lt;/em&gt;) in the sense that we
aim to be efficient rather than wasteful. Do you &lt;em&gt;eat to live&lt;/em&gt; or
&lt;em&gt;live to eat&lt;/em&gt;? Nothing wrong with enjoying nice food when you have it,
but working an extra 20 hours a week to blow on (unnecessary)
alcohol/drugs/luxuries might not be the most prudent use of
time&amp;mdash;especially if these things aren't consumed in a way that
develops something else, such as (human) networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter where we are now in terms of location, money, status, etc.
it is important to manage the resources we have available to us
(especially time) and work hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;memory&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;muscle&lt;/strong&gt;. The urban, modern person is told to
constantly make use of new &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt; which substitutes for these
both. Why &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; anything when Google can do it for you? What use
is muscle mass in the twenty first century when cars, forklifts, and
other machines are used for many tasks that in the past required
bodily strength and endurance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no substitute for developing memory and muscle&amp;mdash;that is
&lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt;. While we may, over the courses of our lives, make use of
many tools which require some specialized learning, training of both
memory and muscle is essential to be an effective human being, all
around. Through cultivating these, we build discipline and endurance
which can serve us in any times&amp;mdash;difficult or "easy". &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The fragmented mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without training memory, our minds are fragmented. By "training
memory" here, I mean being able to &lt;em&gt;recall and reproduce&lt;/em&gt; useful
bodies of knowledge. By a &lt;em&gt;fragmented mind&lt;/em&gt; I mean having uncontrolled
attention and will with nothing firm to grasp&amp;mdash;a vague idea of
what so-and-so said, or why such-and-such is famous, or even how
such-and-such is put together. A day may be driven by thinking &lt;em&gt;what
is for lunch&lt;/em&gt; for the first four hours of the day, punctuated by
recollections of images and sounds from some TV show, followed by
esoteric technical details of some dry read. Then a social interaction
may mean checking a phone for some news&amp;mdash;programmed anxiety. Rest
might be found in distraction&amp;mdash;whether through music, alcohol,
food, chasing "experiences" or some other mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The hyper-literate scatter brain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many modern people have knowledge of a variety of
&lt;em&gt;processes&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;e.g. &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; to look up some information. But this
is different from mastering a systematic body of knowledge. Indeed you
might know the specifics of how to use a few different dictionaries,
but this isn't the same as developing mastery of some language and
being able to &lt;em&gt;recall&lt;/em&gt; words learned and sentence structures for
effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy for many of us to waste hours and hours "surfing the web",
consooming &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;whether through videos or reading articles
or even books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea bad thing here is that rather than &lt;em&gt;building up&lt;/em&gt;
knowledge or &lt;em&gt;training&lt;/em&gt;, we are passively allowing the environment to
fragment us our further. Being able to recognize thousands and
thousands of symbols/songs/etc substitutes for the mastery of bodies
of knowledge and we instead entrap ourselves into being stupid N-gram
models. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You are not too smart for muscle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English, we have expressions like "brains over brawn" or even "work
smarter, not harder" which extol the strength of the "genius" or
"braniac" who can outsmart the dumb brute. Indeed, the Anglo world
(and the Western world more broadly) celebrates its big-braned heroes:
Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Lovelace, Turing... (depends on what
domain you're in, but we've all heard of at least some of these people
through schools, libraries, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this talk is to support the &lt;strong&gt;mythos&lt;/strong&gt; of the "technological
savior". Life was terrible before XYZ technologies, they say. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
And so many people and billions of dollars are put forth towards a
&lt;em&gt;cure for cancer&lt;/em&gt;, with relatively few people investigating the
discipline of &lt;em&gt;fasting&lt;/em&gt;, including its spiritual purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, many "inventions" or "innovations" of the present era do not
really improve anything&amp;mdash;they are just many people happen to use
whereas more generic, older, time-tested ways of doing things suffice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A piece of paper with a list of exercises can replace a "fitness
  app"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking can allow you to spend time memorizing/recalling
  information, learn about your environment, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; give you exercise
  while cutting transportation costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skilled use with a single cooking knife means you do not need a
  bunch of highly-specific tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of following the above suggestions, the modern person often
lives in fear and hopes upon technology for deliverance. They plug in
&lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt; instead of training &lt;em&gt;skill&lt;/em&gt;. Training skill often means
repetition, developing muscle, refining movements, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once semi-jokingly said of myself, "I lose 60% of my abilities when
I"m away from a computer". What a nerd!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical reflection on what we &lt;em&gt;know how to do&lt;/em&gt; and what bodies of
knowledge we possess may reveal... ...well, we have a lot of work to
do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write this post to motivate myself to do better being a competent
human being, and I hope it is useful for some others that may come
across this too. We cannot depend on the US dollar, today's
fashionable technologies, and the latest pop psychology to give us
peace. A disciplined mind and body will do better to prepare us for
the challenges of the world than a comfy job we might happen to have
at one time and place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much computer analysis of language has to do with analyzing
sequences of &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; words or tokens; for instance, &lt;strong&gt;bigrams&lt;/strong&gt; are
sequences of two words, &lt;strong&gt;trigrams&lt;/strong&gt; are sequences of three words,
and so forth. Such approaches just like at &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; and then make
mappings between those forms and other things such as images,
combinations of words in other languages, and so forth.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less commonly discussed is how our technological "improvements"
beget the very problems we're trying to solve. Speculative takes,
such as "we must continue to develop technology because in
millions of years the sun will engulf the earth" OR "we never know
when an asteroid will hit the earth so we must develop spaceships
to colonize other worlds" can be used to bonk non-tech enthusiasts
over the head as "not caring about humanity".&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

switched from typing using the standard QWERTY layout to using the
alternative, more efficient Dvorak layout. However, after using Dvorak
for some time, working my typing speed to over 100 WPM, I ultimately
chose to &lt;em&gt;switch back to QWERTY&lt;/em&gt; (more on my experience
&lt;a href="https://haksayng.com/blog/2017/08/14/relearning-totype/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
Why would anyone re-learn how to type twice&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reasons I had for doing this were,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compatibility with the world at large (I had to help other people
   use their computers), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the gains/advantages I got from switching to an alternative
   keyboard layout came mainly from improved typing technique rather
   than a "better layout".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issues interfacing with software designed for a QWERTY-based
   windows, such as shortcuts keys in games/graphics applications/etc&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great Internet Historian &lt;a href="http://xahlee.info/"&gt;Xah Lee&lt;/a&gt; has called my
default-embracing ways &lt;strong&gt;QWERTY Theory&lt;/strong&gt;. I like this label because
"theory" implies it is &lt;em&gt;not just about keyboards&lt;/em&gt;. It is an approach
to technology generally which advocates &lt;em&gt;making the best use of
commonly available default options, focusing on improving technique
rather than exploiting customization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will detail what QWERTY Theory is and isn't and how it
can help you make a million bucks. Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thou Shalt Not Covet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory inherits from a Judeo-Christian moral framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your
neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or
anything that belongs to your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Exodus 20:17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with the axiom: the basic tools you have in front of you are
good enough. Avert your eyes from the fancy-things others possess and
meditate upon how you can do better with what you already have to face
whatever issues are in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some applications,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing more sustainable typing habits by training new muscle
  memory to hit default key bindings (e.g. pressing the CTRL key with
  your &lt;em&gt;thumbs&lt;/em&gt; rather than pinkies&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing physical training using simple or no equipment (e.g. dumbells
  you already have) rather than signing up for a fancy gym, buying an
  expensive new machine, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practicing more on your $200 guitar instead of looking at ads for a
  $2000 guitar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time may come to upgrade your tools, but for now think about what
you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do, envisioning how you can use the tools you have better.
QWERTY Theory is about pursuing mastery of the mundane, focusing on
building upon rather than inverting tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know Thyself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes
wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Proverbs 11:2 (NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY theory is suitable for non-geniuses who want to be productive
with existing infrastructure. Chances are, you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be
&lt;em&gt;the chosen one&lt;/em&gt; who is going to revolutionize computer input devices
&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, it is important to be able to work effectively with
standard setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may at first seem "efficient" to optimize things like keyboard
entry speed, but there are many "hidden costs" that come with every
deviation from the
"&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software"&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom configurations of software often amounts to demanding special
attention that should be reserved for disabled people who have no
other choice but to use speialized setups. QWERTY theory says to not
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=LARP"&gt;LARP&lt;/a&gt; as being
an oppressed class because being a nerd is a not a disability &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case Study: Fahrenheit vs Celsius&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of alternative ways of doing things (e.g. typing in Dvorak
versus QWERTY) often claim some "scientific" basis for why their way
of doing things is superior. Oftentimes, further inspection reveals
nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, consider the claim that "using Celsius is more
&lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; than using Fahrenheit". Someone
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_(contemporary_subculture)"&gt;hipster&lt;/a&gt;
living in the United States may go around using Celsius and causing
trouble for everyone around them. Is Celsius really &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than
Fahrenheit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at &lt;em&gt;whole integer&lt;/em&gt; values (e.g. 85 degrees F), Fahrenheit
has better resolution than Celsius. This is relevant because sometimes
displays will only allow two or three digits, or only show integer
temperatures rather than crowd the UI with a decimal. If some
numb-skull tells you that Celsius is more "scientific" than
Fahrenheit, just tell them that Celsius and Fahrenheit are both linear
transformations off Kelvin and that you aren't living at sea level and
boiling water there (situation used to determine Celsius' offset from
Kelvin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better reason to use Celsius over Fahrenheit is because Celsius is a
more widely adopted in the world at large; QWERTY Theory! It is not
because Celsius "is more scientific" or some bullshit like that.
It is to fall into line with convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scope Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on who/what we want to engage with in the world, the
&lt;strong&gt;scope&lt;/strong&gt; in which we evaluate what the QWERTY Theory approved choice
is changes. For instance, if you intend to spend your whole life in
the United States doing business almost exclusively with fellow
Americans, then it makes sense to use Fahrenheit all the
time. However, if you are a global traveler, then you must use a more
global &lt;strong&gt;scope resolution&lt;/strong&gt; strategy to choose what a good "default"
is. It may be more practical to you to mainly use Celsius, converting
to Fahrenheit only when necessary, even for someone living in the
United States. In this sense, the &lt;em&gt;globalist&lt;/em&gt; may want the US to adopt
the metric system, celsius, etc. to conform with global standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogous reasoning can be applied to setting up computing
environments.  If you just stay on only one or two of your own
computers and do your own thing all day (e.g. living in a cabin in the
woods), then your &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt; may be just you and what you do. QWERTY
Theory doesn't mean much to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you work in tech support or have friends/family members
around you who also use computers, then suddenly it matters more that
you understand the general computing environments that most people
find themselves in. That is to say, it might be a good idea to have a
Windows machine even if you prefer to do most stuff on Linux yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many nerds eventually repent and turn away from their alt-keyboard
fetishizing, returning to their QWERTYc roots. In "&lt;a href="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/porn_zen_and_vimrc/"&gt;Porn, Zen, and
.vimrc&lt;/a&gt;"
(Koncevičius ) we see a heartfelt confession of an over-config'er (in
this case, someone who dived deeply into customizing the &lt;a href="https://www.vim.org/"&gt;Vim text
editor&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...implemented defaults and design was there for a reason. Some of
my perceived inconsistencies were products of my limited
understanding. I made assumptions about what a particular command
should do, when it should be used, and how. But those assumptions
were not always warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory is about embracing the fact that the shapes technologies
around us have taken have survived and thrived for reasons we may not
immediately understand. Properties may arise that were no individuals'
"original design" but are rather products of processes of
collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY theory protects against the "efficient inefficiency" of
assuming you are more clever than all sorts of people in the past
because you discovered some quick "hack" to optimize something in your
life &lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory is seeing that the "illogical" nature of English
spelling is necessarily "stupid"; there is no need to rush to
&lt;em&gt;optimize English spelling to be more phonetic&lt;/em&gt;. Who assumed a more
phonetic writing system is &lt;em&gt;better?&lt;/em&gt; Perhaps, we should speak more
like how we write instead of writing more like we speak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory is leveraging existing systems, improving technique, and
preparing for full-scale change rather than pre-maturely optimizing
unwieldy channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text input in many other languages builds off QWERTY by default
as well. For instance, I type Japanese and Chinese, which rely on
Romanization for input. The 'underlying keyboard' is QWERTY. For
Korean keyboards too, if you want to be able to quickly switch to
English with one keypress (Windows), this second "layer" will be
QWERTY.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartphones suck. They suck your time and attention. They suck your
bank account(s) dry, especially if you have set up "convenient"
payment systems and find yourself near vending machines stocked with
tasty energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a society, I think it is in our best interest to talk about
smartphones like how we talk about drugs and alcohol. They can be
fun/useful for some things, but definitely not for everyone and
something to be approached with caution. Many wisely choose to abstain
completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Personal Surveillance Devices"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are personalized advertisement aggregating surveillance
devices. You pay money to get tracked. "Security" isn't about &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;,
it's about your digital persona, a marketable product that you do not
own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited privileges you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; grow a big
business, become famous, etc.; likewise, by owning a typewriter you
&lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; write a best-selling novel. Most people don't do this though;
most people lose &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bigly"&gt;bigly&lt;/a&gt; with
most minutes spent on smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use a smartphone, you are given limited access to a little
node on a big &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt;. The
companies that own these graphs are firstly Google and Apple, who
control Android and iOS an their stores, respectively &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  The
tracking doesn't stop there, however. All big "social" apps, including
multiplayer games and other "fun" diversions, have similar tracking
features. Your phone (and by extension Apple and Google) also knows
how much time you spend on each app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, this is OK because "I don't mind being tracked
because I'm not doing anything wrong". That might be a fine view to
have &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, but what will you do if the political fashionistas decide
that some view you have is a Nazi view? Do not support "the purge"
because you expect to get out okay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Physical and Social Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people use their smartphones kinda like personal trainers. Their
phones pump media into their brains while ordering them to do pushups
and stuff (see the "&lt;a href="https://7-min.com/"&gt;7 Minute Workout&lt;/a&gt;", for a
representative example) &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Most people, however, don't use their
smartphones in this way. Their smartphones, rather than functioning as
motivational coaches, work as myopia inducing, posture destroying,
distraction vectors that literally get thousands (more?) of people
killed every year. You might develop &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury"&gt;Repetitive Strain
Injury&lt;/a&gt; from
swiping your thumbs over a glass plate all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart phones force you into &lt;strong&gt;corporate mediated communication&lt;/strong&gt;
because all of the chatting and stuff you do through a smartphone
passes through the filters of &lt;em&gt;someone else's servers&lt;/em&gt;. Sneaky
advertisements influence your thoughts. You may &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you are
ignoring them, the the dark arts of advertisement penetrate deep and
&lt;em&gt;NONE ARE IMMUNE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socially, this means that people are &lt;em&gt;increasingly optimized as
particular types of consumers&lt;/em&gt;. Smartphones put you on an
advertisement to purchase pipeline. Even if you don't choose to buy,
your data will be sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that most people should opt out smartphone use to the best of
their ability. When non-smartphone options are available, these
options should be favored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, many people use their phones to check the time. Seems
benign enough, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What often ends up happening, however, is that the NOTIFICATION SCREEN
pushes all sorts of info into your attention. This is one way in which
the smartphone is a vector of corporate mind viruses; it attacks you
when you are just waiting for a bus or twiddling your thumbs
distracted from homework or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can tweak the settings on your phone to try to suppress
things like the aforementioned notifications. But even still, you are
having faith that our tech overlords (Apple, Google) are doing what
the smartphone UI wants you to believe you are doing. Behind the
scenes, our tech overlords may instead be creating a profile of you as
a "privacy/security concerned user" and trying to optimize the
marketing of some new product to sell to you&amp;mdash;"APPLE VPN" or
something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Privacy" or "productivity" features shouldn't be trusted. The
operating systems themselves are spyware which you have no control
over. Using a smartphone is entering &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, as is using things
like Google Chrome (and probably MacOS, Windows). Sometimes we have to
enter &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; to get things done, but it is not the world we are
native to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tasks where no smart phone is required, not using a smart phone is
preferable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telling time&lt;/strong&gt;: look at a clock/watch; analyze shadows cast on the ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarm clocks, timers, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;: alarm clocks, timers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout&lt;/strong&gt;: stopwatch, friends/coaches/etc.; book/guides/lists on routines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculator&lt;/strong&gt;: learn some mental arithmetic; this is literally
  elementary school level math&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;: paper is fine; dedicated electronic dictionary; PC
  application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps&lt;/strong&gt;: A sense of direction, paper maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding foods&lt;/strong&gt;: just walk into a restaurant and try it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt;: Use this as an opportunity to talk with someone (like
  the British do) &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to give your smartphone &lt;em&gt;as little viewing time as
possible&lt;/em&gt;. When it is time to smartphone, then dive in and smartphone
all the way. But do not kinda smartphone throughout the whole
day. That is a road to misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A good investment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I dislike smartphones, I must admit one place in which they
are extremely efficient economically. This is as a "content creation"
tool for those involved in social media business.  Many people buy
lots of stuff they do not really use, but typically, when people
purchase smart phones they use them &lt;em&gt;a whole lot&lt;/em&gt;. For those that
specialize in bending other people's minds through smartphones, the
smartphone is of course an indispensible tool to use and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also people that specialize in selling cigarettes and
convincing people to join malicious organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not your device&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be tools, but they are tools that are very often far
outside our control. Think &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware"&gt;John Deere
tractors&lt;/a&gt;
(more generally the "&lt;strong&gt;right to repair&lt;/strong&gt;"), but worse because
smartphones are so widespread and are less domain specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are about &lt;em&gt;constraining&lt;/em&gt; users to a certain (small) sets
of actions. Automation is not practically possible for smartphone use
because it is the phone that is supposed to be smart, &lt;em&gt;not you&lt;/em&gt;. Your
job is to populate other people/companies' servers with useful for
data for &lt;em&gt;their ends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you opt to use your smartphone less and consciously do actions
you &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; when you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; decide to use your smartphone, you take control
of your attention and by extension... your LIFE. Shove your smartphone
into a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/faraday-bag/s?k=faraday+bag"&gt;Faraday bag&lt;/a&gt; when you are not using it and laugh as the battery
drains. Today is YOUR DAY to seize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuunibyou&lt;/strong&gt; (中二病; Chūnibyō) is a derogative colloquial term in
the Japanese language used to describe a person who manifests
delusional behavior, particularly thinking that one has special
powers that no other person has. Originally a term used to pertain
to children in the second year of middle school who act like adults,
the term eventually evolved into a term generally used to describe
delusional behavior in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you realized you knew something that a parent or teacher didn't
know. Maybe you were better at something than all of your peers. Maybe
you truly believed you had some sort of super-natural powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Chuunibyou&lt;/em&gt; may be used as an insult, we can embrace this term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;With some imagination, your daily activities become heroic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a student, a lowly corporate wage slave, or otherwise falling
into line to conform to societal norms may be not always be the most
fun thing in the world. Inject some immature thinking, however, and
the every day routine can become lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Desk jobs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to work a bunch of little programs is like knowing how to
cast a bunch of spells. Chaining them together to create solutions,
now that's &lt;em&gt;wizardry!&lt;/em&gt; Composing emails is basically mind control
("delegation").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magical items (computers) become more powerful in the hands of skilled
users. Understanding that when you skillfully operate a computer, you
are translating keystrokes (little finger movements) into BIG ACTIONS in
the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Practicing a musical instrument&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at another activity: playing musical instruments. To play a
musical instrument well you need to train a lot of fine motor control.
Plucking strings? Why that's basically &lt;em&gt;archery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NEETing x Quarantine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanna be with others outside having fun but can't, you may be
experiencing &lt;em&gt;loneliness&lt;/em&gt;. However, if you willfully choose this path,
you may be &lt;em&gt;persuing solitude&lt;/em&gt;. Like a wise sage, a lone wolf rogue, a
hero on a journey...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adventure awaits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcome by a sense of &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ennui"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ennui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you might not be literally slaying dragons out there,
channeling a little bit of immaturity, you can view your own
live as an epic adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of what it means to manifest &lt;em&gt;chuunibyou&lt;/em&gt; are left as an
exercise to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>The Third-Person Self Improvement Program</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/the-third-person-self-improvement-program.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-23T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-23T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-03-23:/pelican-test/the-third-person-self-improvement-program.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cautionary note, 11/12/2020&amp;mdash;stay away any

imagination/visualization technique that separates you from reality.
Occult/esoteric practices should be avoided. There is a "slippery
slope" leading there when you do practices that involve imagining what
is not real, doing stuff with dreams, chanting and/or any form of
invocation. It is better to be sober, vigilant, and industrious. Using
"visualization" insofar as you &lt;em&gt;plan actions to skillfully perform&lt;/em&gt; is
okay I think, but &lt;em&gt;DO NOT&lt;/em&gt; do stuff like imagining yourself in a big
luxury yacht etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original content, below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine yourself from a &lt;em&gt;third person perspective&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;watch
yourself from someone else's viewpoint. What is this person like? Are
they acting in a self-destructive way? Are they good to others? Are
they idealistic but utterly incompetent? How would you describe
yourself in a novel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to look at yourself &lt;strong&gt;objectively&lt;/strong&gt;. Putting aside
present feelings for a moment, how would you evaluate your behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visualization Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you &lt;em&gt;see the money?!?!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lots of popular psychology and business type books, you will see
discussions of various flavors of &lt;strong&gt;visualization&lt;/strong&gt; techniques. That
is, imagining various scenarios. The idea is that your sub-conscious
will then come up with ideas of how to arrive at these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unscientific? Nonsense? Bullshit? I think, not so much. It is hard to
quantify/measure the efficacy of techniques like visualization. But
the fact that so many people have been using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Recipe for Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you sit down and visualize yourself just philosophizing and
getting nothing done for hours on end? Chances are, you probably
cannot sustain this meditation for long. When I try this, my attention
drifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the weather going to be like tomorrow? Oh.. must take a note
on something I want to write about later. My butt itches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualization techniques get you thinking about what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;
do. What are the available actions I can do? What tools do I have at
my disposal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quarantined Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's LARPing time. You are in an RPG called life. Your character is
trapped for some time in a small dungeon. How will you train? What
skills will you level up? What connections will you make? Options are
many, and time (unlike Federal Reserve notes) is limited.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>"Propaganda" as a Descriptive Term</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/propaganda-as-a-descriptive-term.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-26:/pelican-test/propaganda-as-a-descriptive-term.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;propaganda&lt;/strong&gt; is often used as a kind of slur.

people use propaganda, including people you likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

people use propaganda, including people you likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is information that is used primarily to influence an
audience and further an agenda, which may not be objective and may
be presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis
or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional
rather than a rational response to the information that is
presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Definition from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wikipedia definition above is kind of
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neckbeard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;neckbeard-y&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in my opinion, but it is good enough to work from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All those brainwashed sheeple!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you imagine someone in a cult talks? Look at how you and your
in-group(s) signal agreement. Look at what you begin with as
assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not time to bicker about philosophical this-or-that everyday,
so everyone has to take some assumptions about how the world works and
run with that. In some environments, it may more-or-less match up with
the real world. Consider "scientific" thinking; most people most of
the time just take what they are on authority, just like religious
people. Those "marching for science" are not much different from
people at a religious rally. They both assume they are right, and they
are publically displaying their devotion to their ideological cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you do stuff in the real world, you most certainly operate in
social circumstances that more or less force you to acknowledge
certain things as true. Propaganda reinforces these axioms that create
social-cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How we use propaganda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is everywhere and it can be very useful, not just for
controlling others but for controlling ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is super useful for doing things like reaching goals. Goals
are often defined in terms propaganda taught us. Consider listening to
a "work out" playlist. The music you are listening to is &lt;em&gt;literally
mind control waves&lt;/em&gt;, putting you in a kind of rhythmic trance and
making you wanna go show off your enw fit body at the club or
whatever. This can be incredibly motivating for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Reinforcement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, propaganda is useful for signalling in-group
preference. Posting such and such image can signal that you are "one
of the boys" in some group. A mistake can show affiliations you were
trying to hide. The more socialized you are in some group, the better
you are able to recognize insiders and outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dark Arts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to understanding the &lt;strong&gt;Dark Arts&lt;/strong&gt; is to realize the
darkness within yourself. Learn how propaganda operates in your life
already and then you can start to help others defend against it. You
may also choose to channel the dark energy for your benefit, as you
come to understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>No Glasses Meditation</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/no-glasses-meditation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-18T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-18:/pelican-test/no-glasses-meditation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try something for some time.

&lt;h2&gt;An autobiographical account of using computers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I was introduced to computers&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use specific programs to do specific things. MS word is for
writing papers. MS paint is for having fun making digital
drawings. Photoshop is for more serious digital paintings (and

&lt;h2&gt;An autobiographical account of using computers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I was introduced to computers&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use specific programs to do specific things. MS word is for
writing papers. MS paint is for having fun making digital
drawings. Photoshop is for more serious digital paintings (and
editing photos). Games r fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less, I continued to think this way even after I took my first
introduction to programming class (Java in High School). I was
introduced to programming using Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs); large applications that aim to bring all tools necessary for
writing programs together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, however, I began to take note of the fact that I
could &lt;em&gt;use different programs to edit the same sorts of files&lt;/em&gt;. I
think I started to have these thoughts about graphics software. I
realized I could use various editing softwares to do some task like
&lt;em&gt;resizing an image&lt;/em&gt;. Wow, cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I thought of new things I wanted to do with computers, I became
more interested in software generally (specifically &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; software,
as in &lt;em&gt;free beer&lt;/em&gt; because I didn't have a way to pay for stuff
online). I gradually learned more about programming generally, Linux,
and other related things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this has been a lot of fun. It has also caused some trouble for
me, working with other people and their computers. Could I help
someone do XYZ in Microsoft Word? No, because I was too busy fiddling
with LaTeX or Markdown. I guess I could help them Google it? More
recently, by investing lots of time into learning &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"&gt;GNU
emacs&lt;/a&gt;, I've neglected
to learn many useful things in &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;Microsoft's Visual Studio
Code&lt;/a&gt;, the de facto standard for web
development (my day job) these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this rambling leads us to our main topic of
discussion&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;different approaches to computing&lt;/em&gt; and their
relative pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approaches to Computing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people like me who have messed around with a lot of
programs to do a lot of things and are not so super-good at using any
of them. We have fun with computers, get our work done, and are
excited to play around with new technologies (or rediscover) old ones.
Our abilities scale with effort, enthusiasm, and time. We "waste" a
lot of time on the computer in the sense that if we just stuck with a
few things, we could have gotten by with a lot less scattered know-how
and hours spent fiddling with configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to another type of computer user...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The One Program Wonder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain pieces of software out there are very powerful.  If you can
use certain programs well, you can easily turn your visions in reality
(and find high paying work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people learn a small number of programs extremely well and don't
care about the rest. Consider a digital artist/designer that makes use
of Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. This person has awesome
visual powers. With a Macbook pro and a big idea, they can move
mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person might not know how to write a bash script, set up a
printer, or install an operating system. They may call tech support
for help. Are they n00b? Or, consider the hardcore gamer that
concentrates on one game and plays it very well. They may not know how
to do anything else on a computer, but in their domain they are an
unstoppable force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Just make it werk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there are people that believe that &lt;em&gt;by playing (video) games you
already lose&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people spend as little time with computers as possible. Often,
this works out just fine. These are users who can get away with
replacing a laptop or a desktop computer with a tablet. For these
users, the tablet does everything they would want a computer to do,
plus it is generally cheaper, it is more portable, and perhaps more
durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using mobile devices and tablets, there is often only one way really
to do things. There is a single way to do things like change settings,
enter/exit the application, etc. Often this involves clicking,
touching buttons, etc. For nerds, this may be terrible. They may
literally lose sleep over trying to do something in a way UI/UX
designers don't care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just make it werk" users may just give up with their technology and
go socialize, work out, paint pictures, or do something else with
their time while nerds try to pretend Macbooks are Linux machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-reflection on my after-hours computing habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours, I boot up Linux (see my &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html"&gt;Arch Linux install
guide&lt;/a&gt;),
launch emacs (see my &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/captainalan/d2d94f8ff88ba0c74e85560246d51fdf"&gt;config
file&lt;/a&gt;,
and proceed to write code, prose, and everything in between.  Would it
be better to (1) stay in Windows, (2) use a word processor to write
prose, and (3) use an IDE to write code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For quickly getting stuff done, I think that choosing these
conventional solutions would typically be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I consider an activity like &lt;em&gt;writing a letter&lt;/em&gt;, I get excited
about booting up Linux, formatting things nicely in LaTeX and playing
around with emacs commands. But TBH, it would be easier to just start
typing in MS Word or Libre office. I can adjust fonts and stuff to
make things look pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about the "One Program Wonder". I think about the "Just make
it werk" user. These people are doing just fine. And I'm taking three
times as along as I need to to finish some task. But you just wait!
The &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; time I have to do something similar, I'll be faster!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...unless I'm messing around with some new software/configuration
again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Chairs suck.</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-07-20:/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I personally dislike using chairs most of the time.

they came from and why they are everywhere in WEIRD ("Western Educated
Industrial Rich Democratic") cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many centuries, chairs were "a symbolic article of state and
  dignity rather than an article for ordinary use" (Wikipedia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The earliest images of chairs in China are from the sixth century,
  but even then sitting in chairs was rare (Wikipedia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing, multi-story buildings, paper money, and examinations all
    have a longer history than chairs in China!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chairs became mainstream in the West and spread especially fast
  during the time of the "Industrial Revolution" (Chair Institute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nowadays, there are a lot of people &lt;a href="https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/"&gt;hating on
  "sitting"&lt;/a&gt;
  (i.e. chairs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty floors vs clean feet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairs are useful if you are wearing shoes, don't plan on taking them
off, and want to sit down. Note that it is nice to sit down on a bench
or chair to remove your footwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairs are not so good if you want to sit on a rug or reach things
that are close to the floor. Removing sandals or slippers requires to
chairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hot idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many common clothing items we wear were designed for purposes quite
unlike modern living. For example, long pants came from
horse-riding. Few people these days ride horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I live (California), it is usually rather hot. Rather than
following dressing, eating, and sleeping habits of other hot climate
people, many (most?) Californians like to retreat to air conditioned
coffee shops and dress and act like they live in cooler European
(English/German/French?) places. Why?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good uses of chairs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being required for being socially acceptable in a good many
places, there are a number of situations in which having a chair is
useful. To play the piano, for instance, it makes sense to sit on a
comfortably adjusted piano bench so you can reach the pedals under the
piano.&lt;/p&gt;
