to do things. The same goes for the interfaces of many video
games. There is a single way to do things like change settings,
enter/exit the application, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be said for many desktop/laptop computers. For
instance, to install programs on MS Windows or Mac OS, many users just
(manually) go download some installer file and install things. Other
users will make use of Microsoft/Apple's official stores to get their
apps. Finally, some users (usually programmers, developers) make use of 
&lt;strong&gt;package managers&lt;/strong&gt; to do this job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different paths a user may take to do something like "install a
program" represent different approaches to computing, generally. For
instance, we might use some words to embody the three approaches for
installing listed above as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Lemme get what I need to do"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Make it easy and make it feel official, please"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Tedious things should be automated"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user of official app stores (2) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I do these days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours, I boot up Linux (see my &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html"&gt;Arch Linux install
guide&lt;/a&gt;),
launch emacs (see my &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/captainalan/d2d94f8ff88ba0c74e85560246d51fdf"&gt;config
file&lt;/a&gt;,
and proceed to write code, prose, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Chairs suck.</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-07-20:/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I personally dislike chairs and mattresses (for sitting and sleeping,

&lt;h2&gt;Hot weather&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many common clothing items we wear were designed for purposes quite
unlike modern living. For example, long pants came from horse-riding. Few people these days ride horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hot weather, cold weather...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TODO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is a work in progress that can be improved in many
ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Get citations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] Mark where they may be needed&lt;/li&gt;
