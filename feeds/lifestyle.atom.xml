switched from typing using the standard QWERTY layout to using the
alternative, more efficient Dvorak layout. However, after using Dvorak
for some time, working my typing speed to over 100 WPM, I ultimately
chose to &lt;em&gt;switch back to QWERTY&lt;/em&gt; (more on my experience
&lt;a href="https://haksayng.com/blog/2017/08/14/relearning-totype/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
Why would anyone re-learn how to type twice&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reasons I had for doing this were,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compatibility with the world at large (I had to help other people
   use their computers), and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the gains/advantages I got from switching to an alternative
   keyboard layout came mainly from improved typing technique rather
   than a "better layout".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;issues interfacing with software designed for a QWERTY-based
   windows, such as shortcuts keys in games/graphics applications/etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great Internet Historian &lt;a href="http://xahlee.info/"&gt;Xah Lee&lt;/a&gt; has called my
default-embracing ways &lt;strong&gt;QWERTY Theory&lt;/strong&gt;. I like this label because
"theory" implies it is &lt;em&gt;not just about keyboards&lt;/em&gt;. It is an approach
to technology generally which advocates &lt;em&gt;making the best use of
commonly available default options, focusing on improving technique
rather than exploiting customization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will detail what QWERTY Theory is and isn't and how it
can help you make a million bucks. Let's get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thou Shalt Not Covet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory inherits from a Judeo-Christian moral framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your
neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or
anything that belongs to your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Exodus 20:17&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin with the axiom: the basic tools you have in front of you are
good enough. Avert your eyes from the fancy-things others possess and
meditate upon how you can do better with what you already have to face
whatever issues are in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some applications,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing more sustainable typing habits by training new muscle
  memory to hit default key bindings (e.g. pressing the CTRL key with
  your &lt;em&gt;thumbs&lt;/em&gt; rather than pinkies&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing physical training using simple or no equipment (e.g. dumbells
  you already have) rather than signing up for a fancy gym, buying an
  expensive new machine, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practicing more on your $200 guitar instead of looking at ads for a
  $2000 guitar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time may come to upgrade your tools, but for now think about what
you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do, envisioning how you can use the tools you have better.
QWERTY Theory is about pursuing mastery of the mundane, focusing on
building upon rather than inverting tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Know Thyself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes
wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Proverbs 11:2 (NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY theory is suitable for non-geniuses who want to be productive
with existing infrastructure. Chances are, you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be
&lt;em&gt;the chosen one&lt;/em&gt; who is going to revolutionize computer input devices
&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, it is important to be able to work effectively with
standard setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may at first seem "efficient" to optimize things like keyboard
entry speed, but there are many "hidden costs" that come with every
deviation from the
"&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software"&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom configurations of software often amounts to demanding special
attention that should be reserved for disabled people who have no
other choice but to use speialized setups. QWERTY theory says to not
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=LARP"&gt;LARP&lt;/a&gt; as being
an oppressed class because being a nerd is a not a disability &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case Study: Fahrenheit vs Celsius&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of alternative ways of doing things (e.g. typing in Dvorak
versus QWERTY) often claim some "scientific" basis for why their way
of doing things is superior. Oftentimes, further inspection reveals
nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, consider the claim that "using Celsius is more
&lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; than using Fahrenheit". Someone
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_(contemporary_subculture)"&gt;hipster&lt;/a&gt;
living in the United States may go around using Celsius and causing
trouble for everyone around them. Is Celsius really &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than
Fahrenheit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at &lt;em&gt;whole integer&lt;/em&gt; values (e.g. 85 degrees F), Fahrenheit
has better resolution than Celsius. This is relevant because sometimes
displays will only allow two or three digits, or only show integer
temperatures rather than crowd the UI with a decimal. If some
numb-skull tells you that Celsius is more "scientific" than
Fahrenheit, just tell them that Celsius and Fahrenheit are both linear
transformations off Kelvin and that you aren't living at sea level and
boiling water there (situation used to determine Celsius' offset from
Kelvin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better reason to use Celsius over Fahrenheit is because Celsius is a
more widely adopted int he world at large; QWERTY Theory! It is not
because Celsius "is more scientific" or some bullshit like that.
It is to fall into line with convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many nerds eventually repent and turn away from their alt-keyboard
fetishizing, returning to their QWERTYc roots. In "&lt;a href="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/porn_zen_and_vimrc/"&gt;Porn, Zen, and
.vimrc&lt;/a&gt;"
(Koncevičius ) we see a heartfelt confession of an over-config'er (in
this case, someone who dived deeply into customizing the &lt;a href="https://www.vim.org/"&gt;Vim text
editor&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...The simple truth was that, no matter how much energy I invested
in my custom configuration, the people who built and designed Vim
knew it a lot better than me. And it hit me like a cold shower:
implemented defaults and design was there for a reason. Some of my
perceived inconsistencies were products of my limited
understanding. I made assumptions about what a particular command
should do, when it should be used, and how. But those assumptions
were not always warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory is about embracing the fact that the shapes technologies
around us have taken have survived and thrived for reasons we may not
immediately understand. Properties may arise that were no individuals'
"original design" but are rather products of processes of
collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY theory protects against the "efficient inefficiency" of
assuming you are more clever than all sorts of people in the past
because you discovered some quick "hack" to optimize something in your
life &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory is seeing that the "illogical" nature of English
spelling is necessarily "stupid"; there is no need to rush to
&lt;em&gt;optimize English spelling to be more phonetic&lt;/em&gt;. Who assumed a more
phonetic writing system is &lt;em&gt;better?&lt;/em&gt; Perhaps, we should speak more
like how we write instead of writing more like we speak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QWERTY Theory is leveraging existing systems, improving technique, and
preparing for full-scale change rather than pre-maturely optimizing
unwieldy channels.&lt;/p&gt;

flying cars, the elimination of poverty, and anonymous global
crypto-currencies, we got &lt;strong&gt;smartphones&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones suck. They suck your time and attention. They suck your
bank account(s) dry, especially if you have set up "convenient"
payment systems and find yourself near vending machines stocked with
tasty energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a society, I think it is in our best interest to talk about
smartphones like how we talk about drugs and alcohol. They can be
fun/useful for some things, but definitely not for everyone and
something to be approached with caution. Many wisely choose to abstain
completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"Personal Surveillance Devices"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are personalized advertisement aggregating surveillance
devices. You pay money to get tracked. "Security" isn't about &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;,
it's about your digital persona, a marketable product that you do not
own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited privileges you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; grow a big
business, become famous, etc.; likewise, by owning a typewriter you
&lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; write a best-selling novel. Most people don't do this though;
most people lose &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bigly"&gt;bigly&lt;/a&gt; with
most minutes spent on smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use a smartphone, you are given limited access to a little
node on a big &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt;. The
companies that own these graphs are firstly Google and Apple, who
control Android and iOS an their stores, respectively &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  The
tracking doesn't stop there, however. All big "social" apps, including
multiplayer games and other "fun" diversions, have similar tracking
features. Your phone (and by extension Apple and Google) also knows
how much time you spend on each app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, this is OK because "I don't mind being tracked
because I'm not doing anything wrong". That might be a fine view to
have &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, but what will you do if the political fashionistas decide
that some view you have is a Nazi view? Do not support "the purge"
because you expect to get out okay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Physical and Social Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people use their smartphones kinda like personal trainers. Their
phones pump media into their brains while ordering them to do pushups
and stuff (see the "&lt;a href="https://7-min.com/"&gt;7 Minute Workout&lt;/a&gt;", for a
representative example) &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Most people, however, don't use their
smartphones in this way. Their smartphones, rather than functioning as
motivational coaches, work as myopia inducing, posture destroying,
distraction vectors that literally get thousands (more?) of people
killed every year. You might develop &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury"&gt;Repetitive Strain
Injury&lt;/a&gt; from
swiping your thumbs over a glass plate all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart phones force you into &lt;strong&gt;corporate mediated communication&lt;/strong&gt;
because all of the chatting and stuff you do through a smartphone
passes through the filters of &lt;em&gt;someone else's servers&lt;/em&gt;. Sneaky
advertisements influence your thoughts. You may &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you are
ignoring them, the the dark arts of advertisement penetrate deep and
&lt;em&gt;NONE ARE IMMUNE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socially, this means that people are &lt;em&gt;increasingly optimized as
particular types of consumers&lt;/em&gt;. Smartphones put you on an
advertisement to purchase pipeline. Even if you don't choose to buy,
your data will be sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that most people should opt out smartphone use to the best of
their ability. When non-smartphone options are available, these
options should be favored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, many people use their phones to check the time. Seems
benign enough, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What often ends up happening, however, is that the NOTIFICATION SCREEN
pushes all sorts of info into your attention. This is one way in which
the smartphone is a vector of corporate mind viruses; it attacks you
when you are just waiting for a bus or twiddling your thumbs
distracted from homework or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you can tweak the settings on your phone to try to suppress
things like the aforementioned notifications. But even still, you are
having faith that our tech overlords (Apple, Google) are doing what
the smartphone UI wants you to believe you are doing. Behind the
scenes, our tech overlords may instead be creating a profile of you as
a "privacy/security concerned user" and trying to optimize the
marketing of some new product to sell to you&amp;mdash;"APPLE VPN" or
something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Privacy" or "productivity" features shouldn't be trusted. The
operating systems themselves are spyware which you have no control
over. Using a smartphone is entering &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, as is using things
like Google Chrome (and probably MacOS, Windows). Sometimes we have to
enter &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; to get things done, but it is not the world we are
native to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For tasks where no smart phone is required, not using a smart phone is
preferable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telling time&lt;/strong&gt;: look at a clock/watch; analyze shadows cast on the ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarm clocks, timers, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;: alarm clocks, timers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout&lt;/strong&gt;: stopwatch, friends/coaches/etc.; book/guides/lists on routines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculator&lt;/strong&gt;: learn some mental arithmetic; this is literally
  elementary school level math&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;: paper is fine; dedicated electronic dictionary; PC
  application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps&lt;/strong&gt;: A sense of direction, paper maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding foods&lt;/strong&gt;: just walk into a restaurant and try it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt;: Use this as an opportunity to talk with someone (like
  the British do) &lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to give your smartphone &lt;em&gt;as little viewing time as
possible&lt;/em&gt;. When it is time to smartphone, then dive in and smartphone
all the way. But do not kinda smartphone throughout the whole
day. That is a road to misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A good investment?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I dislike smartphones, I must admit one place in which they
are extremely efficient economically. This is as a "content creation"
tool for those involved in social media business.  Many people buy
lots of stuff they do not really use, but typically, when people
purchase smart phones they use them &lt;em&gt;a whole lot&lt;/em&gt;. For those that
specialize in bending other people's minds through smartphones, the
smartphone is of course an indispensible tool to use and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also people that specialize in selling cigarettes and
convincing people to join malicious organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not your device&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be tools, but they are tools that are very often far
outside our control. Think &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware"&gt;John Deere
tractors&lt;/a&gt;
(more generally the "&lt;strong&gt;right to repair&lt;/strong&gt;"), but worse because
smartphones are so widespread and are less domain specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are about &lt;em&gt;constraining&lt;/em&gt; users to a certain (small) sets
of actions. Automation is not practically possible for smartphone use
because it is the phone that is supposed to be smart, &lt;em&gt;not you&lt;/em&gt;. Your
job is to populate other people/companies' servers with useful for
data for &lt;em&gt;their ends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you opt to use your smartphone less and consciously do actions
you &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; when you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; decide to use your smartphone, you take control
of your attention and by extension... your LIFE. Shove your smartphone
into a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/faraday-bag/s?k=faraday+bag"&gt;Faraday bag&lt;/a&gt; when you are not using it and laugh as the battery
drains. Today is YOUR DAY to seize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us engage in some self-deprecation. Surely, most of us have at

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chuunibyou&lt;/strong&gt; (中二病; Chūnibyō) is a derogative colloquial term in
the Japanese language used to describe a person who manifests
delusional behavior, particularly thinking that one has special
powers that no other person has. Originally a term used to pertain
to children in the second year of middle school who act like adults,
the term eventually evolved into a term generally used to describe
delusional behavior in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://animanga.fandom.com/wiki/Chuunibyou"&gt;animanga.fandom.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you realized you knew something that a parent or teacher didn't
know. Maybe you were better at something than all of your peers. Maybe
you truly believed you had some sort of super-natural powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Chuunibyou&lt;/em&gt; may be used as an insult, we can embrace this term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;With some imagination, your daily activities become heroic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a student, a lowly corporate wage slave, or otherwise falling
into line to conform to societal norms may be not always be the most
fun thing in the world. Inject some immature thinking, however, and
the every day routine can become lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Desk jobs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to work a bunch of little programs is like knowing how to
cast a bunch of spells. Chaining them together to create solutions,
now that's &lt;em&gt;wizardry!&lt;/em&gt; Composing emails is basically mind control
("delegation").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magical items (computers) become more powerful in the hands of skilled
users. Understanding that when you skillfully operate a computer, you
are translating keystrokes (little finger movements) into BIG ACTIONS in
the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Practicing a musical instrument&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at another activity: playing musical instruments. To play a
musical instrument well you need to train a lot of fine motor control.
Plucking strings? Why that's basically &lt;em&gt;archery&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NEETing x Quarantine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanna be with others outside having fun but can't, you may be
experiencing &lt;em&gt;loneliness&lt;/em&gt;. However, if you willfully choose this path,
you may be &lt;em&gt;persuing solitude&lt;/em&gt;. Like a wise sage, a lone wolf rogue, a
hero on a journey...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adventure awaits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcome by a sense of &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ennui"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ennui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you might not be literally slaying dragons out there,
channeling a little bit of immaturity, you can view your own
live as an epic adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of what it means to manifest &lt;em&gt;chuunibyou&lt;/em&gt; are left as an

&lt;h2&gt;Visualization Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you &lt;em&gt;see the money?!?!?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lots of popular psychology and business type books, you will see
discussions of various flavors of &lt;strong&gt;visualization&lt;/strong&gt; techniques. That
is, imagining various scenarios. The idea is that your sub-conscious
will then come up with ideas of how to arrive at these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unscientific? Nonsense? Bullshit? I think, not so much. It is hard to
quantify/measure the efficacy of techniques like visualization. But
the fact that so many people have been using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Recipe for Action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you sit down and visualize yourself just philosophizing and
getting nothing done for hours on end? Chances are, you probably
cannot sustain this meditation for long. When I try this, my attention
drifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the weather going to be like tomorrow? Oh.. must take a note
on something I want to write about later. My butt itches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualization techniques get you thinking about what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;
do. What are the available actions I can do? What tools do I have at
my disposal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quarantined Times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's LARPing time. You are in an RPG called life. Your character is
trapped for some time in a small dungeon. How will you train? What
skills will you level up? What connections will you make? Options are
many, and time (unlike Federal Reserve notes) is limited.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>"Propaganda" as a Descriptive Term</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/propaganda-as-a-descriptive-term.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-26:/pelican-test/propaganda-as-a-descriptive-term.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;strong&gt;propaganda&lt;/strong&gt; is often used as a kind of slur.

people use propaganda, including people you likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

people use propaganda, including people you likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is information that is used primarily to influence an
audience and further an agenda, which may not be objective and may
be presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis
or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional
rather than a rational response to the information that is
presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Definition from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wikipedia definition above is kind of
&lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neckbeard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;neckbeard-y&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in my opinion, but it is good enough to work from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All those brainwashed sheeple!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you imagine someone in a cult talks? Look at how you and your
in-group(s) signal agreement. Look at what you begin with as
assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not time to bicker about philosophical this-or-that everyday,
so everyone has to take some assumptions about how the world works and
run with that. In some environments, it may more-or-less match up with
the real world. Consider "scientific" thinking; most people most of
the time just take what they are on authority, just like religious
people. Those "marching for science" are not much different from
people at a religious rally. They both assume they are right, and they
are publically displaying their devotion to their ideological cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you do stuff in the real world, you most certainly operate in
social circumstances that more or less force you to acknowledge
certain things as true. Propaganda reinforces these axioms that create
social-cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How we use propaganda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is everywhere and it can be very useful, not just for
controlling others but for controlling ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is super useful for doing things like reaching goals. Goals
are often defined in terms propaganda taught us. Consider listening to
a "work out" playlist. The music you are listening to is &lt;em&gt;literally
mind control waves&lt;/em&gt;, putting you in a kind of rhythmic trance and
making you wanna go show off your enw fit body at the club or
whatever. This can be incredibly motivating for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social Reinforcement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, propaganda is useful for signalling in-group
preference. Posting such and such image can signal that you are "one
of the boys" in some group. A mistake can show affiliations you were
trying to hide. The more socialized you are in some group, the better
you are able to recognize insiders and outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dark Arts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to understanding the &lt;strong&gt;Dark Arts&lt;/strong&gt; is to realize the
darkness within yourself. Learn how propaganda operates in your life
already and then you can start to help others defend against it. You
may also choose to channel the dark energy for your benefit, as you
come to understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>No Glasses Meditation</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/no-glasses-meditation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-18T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2020-02-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2020-02-18:/pelican-test/no-glasses-meditation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try something for some time.

&lt;h2&gt;An autobiographical account of using computers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I was introduced to computers&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use specific programs to do specific things. MS word is for
writing papers. MS paint is for having fun making digital
drawings. Photoshop is for more serious digital paintings (and

&lt;h2&gt;An autobiographical account of using computers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how I was introduced to computers&amp;mdash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use specific programs to do specific things. MS word is for
writing papers. MS paint is for having fun making digital
drawings. Photoshop is for more serious digital paintings (and
editing photos). Games r fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less, I continued to think this way even after I took my first
introduction to programming class (Java in High School). I was
introduced to programming using Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs); large applications that aim to bring all tools necessary for
writing programs together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, however, I began to take note of the fact that I
could &lt;em&gt;use different programs to edit the same sorts of files&lt;/em&gt;. I
think I started to have these thoughts about graphics software. I
realized I could use various editing softwares to do some task like
&lt;em&gt;resizing an image&lt;/em&gt;. Wow, cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I thought of new things I wanted to do with computers, I became
more interested in software generally (specifically &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; software,
as in &lt;em&gt;free beer&lt;/em&gt; because I didn't have a way to pay for stuff
online). I gradually learned more about programming generally, Linux,
and other related things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this has been a lot of fun. It has also caused some trouble for
me, working with other people and their computers. Could I help
someone do XYZ in Microsoft Word? No, because I was too busy fiddling
with LaTeX or Markdown. I guess I could help them Google it? More
recently, by investing lots of time into learning &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html"&gt;GNU
emacs&lt;/a&gt;, I've neglected
to learn many useful things in &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;Microsoft's Visual Studio
Code&lt;/a&gt;, the de facto standard for web
development (my day job) these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this rambling leads us to our main topic of
discussion&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;different approaches to computing&lt;/em&gt; and their
relative pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approaches to Computing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people like me who have messed around with a lot of
programs to do a lot of things and are not so super-good at using any
of them. We have fun with computers, get our work done, and are
excited to play around with new technologies (or rediscover) old ones.
Our abilities scale with effort, enthusiasm, and time. We "waste" a
lot of time on the computer in the sense that if we just stuck with a
few things, we could have gotten by with a lot less scattered know-how
and hours spent fiddling with configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to another type of computer user...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The One Program Wonder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain pieces of software out there are very powerful.  If you can
use certain programs well, you can easily turn your visions in reality
(and find high paying work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people learn a small number of programs extremely well and don't
care about the rest. Consider a digital artist/designer that makes use
of Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. This person has awesome
visual powers. With a Macbook pro and a big idea, they can move
mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person might not know how to write a bash script, set up a
printer, or install an operating system. They may call tech support
for help. Are they n00b? Or, consider the hardcore gamer that
concentrates on one game and plays it very well. They may not know how
to do anything else on a computer, but in their domain they are an
unstoppable force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Just make it werk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, there are people that believe that &lt;em&gt;by playing (video) games you
already lose&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people spend as little time with computers as possible. Often,
this works out just fine. These are users who can get away with
replacing a laptop or a desktop computer with a tablet. For these
users, the tablet does everything they would want a computer to do,
plus it is generally cheaper, it is more portable, and perhaps more
durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using mobile devices and tablets, there is often only one way really
to do things. There is a single way to do things like change settings,
enter/exit the application, etc. Often this involves clicking,
touching buttons, etc. For nerds, this may be terrible. They may
literally lose sleep over trying to do something in a way UI/UX
designers don't care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just make it werk" users may just give up with their technology and
go socialize, work out, paint pictures, or do something else with
their time while nerds try to pretend Macbooks are Linux machines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-reflection on my after-hours computing habits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hours, I boot up Linux (see my &lt;a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/arch-linux-install-for-n00bs.html"&gt;Arch Linux install
guide&lt;/a&gt;),
launch emacs (see my &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/captainalan/d2d94f8ff88ba0c74e85560246d51fdf"&gt;config
file&lt;/a&gt;,
and proceed to write code, prose, and everything in between.  Would it
be better to (1) stay in Windows, (2) use a word processor to write
prose, and (3) use an IDE to write code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For quickly getting stuff done, I think that choosing these
conventional solutions would typically be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I consider an activity like &lt;em&gt;writing a letter&lt;/em&gt;, I get excited
about booting up Linux, formatting things nicely in LaTeX and playing
around with emacs commands. But TBH, it would be easier to just start
typing in MS Word or Libre office. I can adjust fonts and stuff to
make things look pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about the "One Program Wonder". I think about the "Just make
it werk" user. These people are doing just fine. And I'm taking three
times as along as I need to to finish some task. But you just wait!
The &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; time I have to do something similar, I'll be faster!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...unless I'm messing around with some new software/configuration
again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifestyle"></category></entry><entry><title>Chairs suck.</title><link href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alan Wong</name></author><id>tag:captainalan.github.io,2019-07-20:/pelican-test/chairs-suck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I personally dislike using chairs most of the time.

the floor, stand, or walk around to work, reading, thinking,

decided to do a little "armchair" research on chairs to find out where
they came from and why they are everywhere in WEIRD ("Western Educated
Industrial Rich Democratic") cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many centuries, chairs were "a symbolic article of state and
  dignity rather than an article for ordinary use" (Wikipedia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The earliest images of chairs in China are from the sixth century,
  but even then sitting in chairs was rare (Wikipedia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing, multi-story buildings, paper money, and examinations all
    have a longer history than chairs in China!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chairs became mainstream in the West and spread especially fast
  during the time of the "Industrial Revolution" (Chair Institute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nowadays, there are a lot of people &lt;a href="https://www.startstanding.org/sitting-new-smoking/"&gt;hating on
  "sitting"&lt;/a&gt;
  (i.e. chairs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dirty floors vs clean feet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairs are useful if you are wearing shoes, don't plan on taking them
off, and want to sit down. Note that it is nice to sit down on a bench
or chair to remove your footwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairs are not so good if you want to sit on a rug or reach things
that are close to the floor. Removing sandals or slippers requires to
chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Beatles observe George learning Sitar. July 1966." src="https://i.imgur.com/Ci5mHRE.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Source imgur)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hot idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many common clothing items we wear were designed for purposes quite
unlike modern living. For example, long pants came from
horse-riding. Few people these days ride horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I live (California), it is usually rather hot. Rather than
following dressing, eating, and sleeping habits of other hot climate
people, many (most?) Californians like to retreat to air conditioned
coffee shops and dress and act like they live in cooler European
(English/German/French?) places. Why?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good uses of chairs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being required for being socially acceptable in a good many
places, there are a number of situations in which having a chair is
useful. To play the piano, for instance, it makes sense to sit on a
comfortably adjusted piano bench so you can reach the pedals under the
piano.&lt;/p&gt;
