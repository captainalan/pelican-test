</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This week, I've been working on learning <strong>DevOps</strong> things. From
wikip, a definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DevOps</strong> is a set of practices that combines software development
(Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems
development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high
software quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In plain English, I call DevOps something like "looking into how to
take software that people write and get it where it needs to be to
<em>get work done</em>".</p>
<p>Different people do different jobs: e.g. designers design fancy apps,
web programers write code to implement fancy apps, and analysts crunch
numbers to figure out how to make money off those fancy apps.</p>
<p>DevOps is smashing all this work together into something that does
work in the real world. It is trying to automate much of the process,
making it easy to <strong>scale</strong> operations, do fast fixes, etc.</p>
<h1>Applying Knowledge from Hobbies</h1>
<p>I decided to look into this field because I already enjoy doing things
like configuring linux, working with command line tools, etc.</p>
<p>I was having trouble finding programing/coding projects that
interested me because oftentimes, the software I might want to write
<em>already exists</em>&mdash;it just needs to be configured and run
somewhere. For example, this blog that you are reading was made using
a <strong>static site generator</strong>. It could be interesting and educational
to go write my own static site generator, but really this program does
everything I need it to do. I just write text in an easy to read/use
language (markdown) and web pages get generated&mdash;amazing! I can
publish a live journal here, backed up/preserved by our friends at
Github x Microsoft.</p>
<p>Compared with this site, there are more complicated projects (such as
ones that have <em>interactivity</em>) one may want to deploy. Dumping a
bunch of HTML pages and images (examples of <strong>static assets</strong>) on the
Internet is often not hard. How about deploying a program that
interacts with some database? A place to submit a form to?</p>
<h3>Setting stuff up automatically</h3>
<p>Much of DevOps is writing configuration files (which are <em>declarations
of how stuff should be</em>). These files get read by programs that run
other programs (that run other programs, that run other programs...).</p>
<p>On a local level, doing this has been great fun. DevOps sounds like an
in-demand place to do similar things, at scale.</p>
<h3>Future goals</h3>
<p>As a direction for <em>what to learn more about</em>, I think that learning
more about the <em>operations</em> part of DevOps and how to coordinate 
people and teams is a good direction to move into for a future
involving building useful things to help us all live better lives.</p>
