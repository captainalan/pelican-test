</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The term <strong>propaganda</strong> is often used as a kind of slur. Here, I want
to discuss "propaganda" used as a <strong>descriptive</strong> term. All sorts of
people use propaganda, including people you likely.</p>
<p>Here's a definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Propaganda is information that is used primarily to influence an
audience and further an agenda, which may not be objective and may
be presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis
or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional
rather than a rational response to the information that is
presented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Definition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>The wikipedia definition above is kind of
<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neckbeard"><strong>neckbeard-y</strong></a>
in my opinion, but it is good enough to work from.</p>
<h2>All those brainwashed sheeple!</h2>
<p>How do you imagine someone in a cult talks? Look at how you and your
in-group(s) signal agreement. Look at what you begin with as
assumptions.</p>
<p>There is not time to bicker about philosophical this-or-that everyday,
so everyone has to take some assumptions about how the world works and
run with that. In some environments, it may more-or-less match up with
the real world. Consider "scientific" thinking; most people most of
the time just take what they are on authority, just like religious
people. Those "marching for science" are not much different from
people at a religious rally. They both assume they are right, and they
are publically displaying their devotion to their ideological cause.</p>
<p>Assuming you do stuff in the real world, you most certainly operate in
social circumstances that more or less force you to acknowledge
certain things as true. Propaganda reinforces these axioms that create
social-cohesion.</p>
<h2>How we use propaganda</h2>
<p>Propaganda is everywhere and it can be very useful, not just for
controlling others but for controlling ourselves.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Propaganda is super useful for doing things like reaching goals. Goals
are often defined in terms propaganda taught us. Consider listening to
a "work out" playlist. The music you are listening to is <em>literally
mind control waves</em>, putting you in a kind of rhythmic trance and
making you wanna go show off your enw fit body at the club or
whatever. This can be incredibly motivating for many people.</p>
<h3>Social Reinforcement</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, propaganda is useful for signalling in-group
preference. Posting such and such image can signal that you are "one
of the boys" in some group. A mistake can show affiliations you were
trying to hide. The more socialized you are in some group, the better
you are able to recognize insiders and outsiders.</p>
<h3>The Dark Arts</h3>
<p>The first step to understanding the <strong>Dark Arts</strong> is to realize the
darkness within yourself. Learn how propaganda operates in your life
already and then you can start to help others defend against it. You
may also choose to channel the dark energy for your benefit, as you
come to understand it better.</p>
