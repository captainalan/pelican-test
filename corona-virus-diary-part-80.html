</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The weather is getting colder as we advance into December. Many people
seem to be <em>just waiting</em> for current stuff to clear up. With respect
to state-wide policy and other administrative issues, most of us don't
really have any say in how stuff goes. Overshadowing all of this is
glowing LCD screens, broadcasting the latest doom-figures while
disempowering people from doing anything aside from cowering in their
own quarters to "help".</p>
<p>It is tricky to "disagree" with the official narrative at all. This is
how <strong>"science"</strong> is wielded as a bludgeon; people see <em>numbers</em> and
they think <em>facts</em> instinctively. In many posts here I've expressed
thoughts about how numbers are only as meaningful as <em>what we're
counting</em> and how numbers are interpretted rely on the <em>assumptions</em>
of our models.</p>
<p>And so, more than anything, we see an <em>appeal to authority</em> and a
demonstration of <em>faith</em> in the "secular" government of increasingly
less subtle <strong>scientism</strong>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<h2>The importance of engaging reality</h2>
<p>US dollars are <em>a thing</em>, but they're not simple to behold like a
fresh piece of fruit or a pencil. USD, unlike things that are right in
front of you, are freely manipulated by authorities you do not choose.</p>
<p>We all have to live in this world, so it is necessary to deal with
fiat currency of some kind. Some people are good at this "game" and
acquire many more dollars with less effort. What does this metric
measure?</p>
<p>There are other things in life which are far more <em>real</em> than USD in
the sense that their value is immediately apparent outside of the
power of the global financial elite. For starters, there is your body,
your thoughts, and your relationships with the people around you.</p>
<p>Clearly, there are sick, mentally unwell rich people who are despised
by all around them. Likewise, there are poor people who have peace
with themselves and everyone around them.</p>
<h2>Writing a life story</h2>
<p>The clock keeps ticking whether under lock down or not. Prison is a
punishment because the prisoner is deprived of freedom; time they
might spend getting wealthy, enjoying fancy food, etc is taken away.</p>

<p>Spending time indoors, in a room, you can think of <em>what you
know</em> and <em>how you know it</em>. Kids that have to go to school during
lock-down&mdash;what are they learning and how do they know it is
true? Much boils down to trust in authorities. Sometimes, we don't
<em>lie</em>, but simply pass on things we were taught (but have not
confirmed for ourselves); we are thus messengers of
<em>misinformation</em>. Some people may try to pass of a "Noble Lie" as
some means to an end.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
