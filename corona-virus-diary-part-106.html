</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>One tool for decision making is <strong>casting lots</strong>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Often, we aren't sure
which of multiple choices is better. So rather than being held back by
<em>inaction</em> ("paralysis by analysis"), we can appeal to some <em>random</em> process
to give us a decision. I use the word "random" here in the sense that <em>you</em> don't
know whether a coin will come up heads or tails&mdash;we'll go with the
intuitive notion of this rather than try to formalize it with complicated
maths.</p>
<p>The method of casting lots is easy; just assign options to outcomes and run a
random number generator, flip some coins, etc.  Studying some probability
theory (<strong>discrete math</strong> generally is probably useful too) can show you more
sophisticated things to do.</p>
<h2>Action!</h2>
<p>Getting organized can make the tasks of many (most?) days well laid out.
Sometimes, however, we may be asked questions or asked to make decisions on
things we don't really have a clear "reading" on. <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Bashing your head
against a wall probably isn't going to make anything more clear plus you have
other things to do. How should you proceed?</p>
<p>Casting lots is an application of <strong>faith</strong> in that you are deciding to free up
your attention/focus from some present issue and accepting whatever outcome the
"random" process gives you.</p>
<p>Rather than being stuck <em>doing nothing</em>, you <em>trust a process</em> having done
other preparations/thinking already.</p>

<p>I've been with groups friends who have spent too long answering some
  question like, "where should we go to eat?". As I've gotten older, I've found
  that things I've taken for granted in the past&mdash;like meeting up with
  friends&mdash;can actually be a very difficult thing to happen. If you only
  see some friend like... once a year, do you really want to waste time talking
  about <em>where to eat?</em>&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
