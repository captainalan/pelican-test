</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This month, Google told me that <em>I only walked 3 miles!</em> I purposely
leave location tracking and stuff on my phone. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> What a sad, low
number! Maybe it is better if I <strong>virtue signal</strong> to Google.</p>
<p>So, this month, I'm doing an experiment. As much as I can, even
walking around the house, I'm going to leave my phone in my pocket.
We'll see how good Google's location tracking is; will it catch these
relatively small movements (at the same address, but moving around
within that location)?</p>
<h1>What's in store</h1>
<p>It kinda feels like being in a giant store all the time. When you
visit Target or something, you can expect cameras everywhere watching
to make sure people don't steal merchandise, cause trouble with
employees, etc. Likewise, the store obviously has a goal to sell you
stuff.</p>
<p>In this way, I have no problem with surveillance and cameras and stuff
<em>per se</em>. However, I think that it is not unreasonable for people to
want private spaces in addition to public spaces. When private spaces
are constantly invaded by activitites like soliciting, marketing, etc.
this is no good.</p>
<p>Practically, each individual can decide what spaces they think should
be private and make rules/policies/schedules to keep it this way.
People may come up with rules like,</p>
<ul>
<li>No politics talk at the dinner table </li>
<li>No phones out when friends meet</li>
<li>Don't watch YouTube videos until 8 PM; go to sleep by midnight</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially at first, it takes discipline to do these things. Strong
 leadership is needed to bring changes to groups as well&mdash;e.g.
 parents must be able to follow these rules themselves so children can
 see why they are so.</p>
