</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today I'm going to return to a psychological/philosophical topic:
<em>words and thinking</em>. I'll elaborate more below, but the main way this
all relates to COVID-19 is that <em>the primary way most of us understand
what's going on is through words</em>.</p>
<p>Words are great for lots of things, but they have their
limitations. There are many <strong>non-verbal</strong> ways to think about stuff,
e.g. spatially, in terms of math, through working with programing
languages,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinaesthetics">kinaesthetically</a>, etc.</p>
<p>The danger of thinking about things mainly (or exclusively) in verbal
terms is the ease at which <em>words</em> can be associated with <em>emotions</em>.
While we think we are learning about the world, we can easily get
wrapped up in somebody's "Matrix of words" <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. The lock-in policies
of governments around the world are making words increasingly
important because words are now serving&mdash;more than ever&mdash;as
the main interface by which people are finding out about the world
beyond their locked-in doors.</p>
<h2>Words as an interface to understand the world</h2>
<p>Lock-in policies mean people learn about more and more things
indirectly/vicariously through words. We are not going outside and
observing things directly as much as before; we are taking what people
say to us on <em>faith</em>.</p>
<p>The nature of COVID-19 exacerbates this situation. COVID-19 is an
"invisible enemy" <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>; we can't see it like we might see flying
saucers in the sky or giant sea monsters at our coasts. It is even
less visceral than climate change, which we can see in pictures of sad
polar bears.</p>
<h3>Words are everywhere</h3>
<p>Words permeate thinking in lots and lots of places. Here's some examples,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Songs</strong> as the most popular form of music; music set to <strong>lyrics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong> associate words with images</li>
<li><strong>Verbal Explanations</strong>&mdash;using "different words" to try to
  express the meanings of some words</li>
<li><strong>Mantras</strong>&mdash;repeating words, strongly associating them with
  some mental state</li>
</ul>
<p>As the old saying goes, "you can't believe everything you see in (the)
movies". Likewise, we have the more modern saying, "you can't believe
everything you read on the Internet".</p>
<p>These "common sense" statements reveal an often forgotten
truth. Things like books and films don't have to "obey reality" in the
same way that... we must respect gravity. People can say and show all
sorts of things.</p>
<p>The media we consume, the verbal explanations we hear, and the mantras
we repeat contribute to our <code>verbal &lt;-&gt; emotional</code> mapping.  This is
inescapable; insofar as you speak a language, words are going to
affect you. What we can control, however, is the inputs we consume to
inform our own mappings.</p>
<h2>Responding to "Hyperverbalism"</h2>
<p>I think that is important to do "non-verbal activities". Here's some
examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instrumental music</li>
<li>Workout/exercise (try <em>without music/podcasts/etc</em>)</li>
<li>Drawing/painting (do visual arts; see shapes and stuff rather than
  trying to point out things you have words for like "eyes" and
  "mouth") <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Math</li>
<li>Programing (think <em>in the programing language</em> as opposed to English
  or whatever language you default to) <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with being "hyperverbal" is that you are easily controlled
because the use of such-and-such trigger words gives pretty consistent
emotional responses. Think of a person you know that is particularly
vulnerable to "it's not what you said, it's <em>how you said it</em>".</p>
<p>Practicing observing reality in ways that aren't mediated by words is
helpful to protect yourself from emotional manipulation and to also
see new things that the words you conceptualize the world with may
have previously concealed from you.</p>
<h2>Moar Media and Notes</h2>
<p>Below are some readings/videos that have influenced my thinking on
these topics</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3s47-p9rE0">"Were the Ancients Morons? (Translation and
  Mindset)"</a> (Luke Smith;
  January 29, 2019)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Right-Side-Brain-Definitive/dp/1585429201">*Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</a> (Betty Edwards; 1979)</li>
<li><a href="http://royharrisonline.com/INP27.html">"On 'primitive' languages in linguistic theory"</a> (Roy Harris; 2010)</li>
<li>Linguist Roy Harris on monolingual dictionaries; don't have specific references now</li>
<li>N.T. Taleb has treated the topics discussed here; don't have specific references now</li>
</ul>
<p>There was some Luke Smith video that talked specifically about people
who only "think in words", but I can't find it at this time.</p>

<p>Aside from President Trump using this term fairly recently; I'm
not sure what connotations this term carries&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>In my childhood, I read the book <em>Drawing on the Right Side of
the Brain</em> which had some exercises training me in this; I
wouldn't necessarily get excited about the LEFT/RIGHT brain
science localization bandwagon, but the exercises this book
presented were useful nonetheless&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>I think the idea that languages like Python are easier because
they "read more like English" is nonsense because whenever you
learn something specialized/technical, you need to learn new
senses of words. Having programing language keywords in your
language (like <code>if</code>, <code>then</code>, etc) may be helpful at first to
remember the keyword itself, but soon after it really doesn't
matter since you have to learn the specialized/technical senses of
these words. In this way, I think that making "programing
languages in Chinese/Arabic/Hindi" etc. doesn't really matter. You
<em>could</em> make alternative keywords or something, but I think most
people will want to default to ASCII keywords...&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
