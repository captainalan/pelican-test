</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The morning air is refreshing&mdash;getting up and moving (location)
makes stuff feel better. Staying in the same room, even if doing
exercises like pushups and stuff, is not the same as using one's feet
to move about. The explainers of the world may speak of Vitamin D or
Serotonin or all sorts of other things I do not understand&mdash;maybe
they are right. I do not feel like reading such-and-such scientific article
now; I walk outside because it is what I want to do. </p>
<p>Today I wear no mask and likewise do not walk near anyone. I just
wanna go for a walk. I don't want to have to think about such-and-such
rules. I just want to live and let live; can I just cherish some <em>muh
freedoms?</em></p>
<p>Today, no words are needed to explain why a walk is nice.</p>
<h2>A Word Governed World</h2>
<p>I recall visiting Tokyo, Japan. One thing that stood out to me was
that there were <em>words</em> everywhere, all the time. A door opens&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Doa-ga akimasu</em><br>
"The door is opening"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...a door closes...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Doa-ga shimarimasu</em><br>
"The door is closing"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verbiage was overwhelming. Words everywhere all the time, imposing
their model of the world into the minds of the city dwellers.</p>
<h3>Muh Roads</h3>
<p>In the novel IQ84, Haruki Murakami alludes to Anton Chekhov's
<em>Sakhalin Island</em> (1893-94) travel diary, describing a people group
who <em>have no need for roads</em>. Roads are important in a modern, urban
societies because we need things like addresses to ship stuff, flat
surfaces for large garbage trucks to roll over, and so on and so
forth. For a more "primitive" group of people, roads are not so
useful.</p>
<p>The trail runner may complain about how coating everything in concrete
destroys runners' knees.</p>
<h3>Muh Words</h3>
<p>In a similar way to how roads impose civil order on the ground,
<em>words</em> are used to impose civil order in our minds.</p>
<p>Before having words distinguishing such-and-such from this-and-that,
the distinctions may not be present in people's minds.</p>
<p>For instance, I hear many overseas Chinese people upset that
non-overseas Chinese laypeople do not understand distinctions like,</p>
<ul>
<li>American Born Chinese versus "China Chinese"</li>
<li>Taiwan vs China vs Hong Kong</li>
<li>Mandarin vs Cantonese</li>
</ul>
<p>These distinctions are clear to a person cultured into a particular
way; mislabeling could get you into a lot of trouble socially!</p>
<p>Yet to the South Asian living in the West, these issues may not be so
apparent. Overseas Chinese issues are just all <em>foreign</em>. Likewise,
most Overseas Chinese probably think very little of issues like,</p>
<ul>
<li>India vs Pakistan vs Bangladesh</li>
<li>Hindi vs Punjabi vs Marathi vs Gujarati...</li>
<li>Hindu vs Muslim vs Sikh...</li>
<li>North vs South Indian style cuisines</li>
</ul>
<p>Particular words and concepts are useful for particular contexts,
which are often culture specific. Trapped on a desert island with a
motley crew of people of diverse backgrounds, the utility of many of
these distinctions rapidly diminishes.</p>
<h2>The COVID-19 News Cycle Withdrawal</h2>
<p>As the COVID-19 situation continues, I am seeing more and more people
"checking out" of trying to keep up with news and stuff. Some of these
people are avid "media junkies" who pride themselves on their volume
of consumption and info-hoarding.</p>
<p>We were given words to describe this situation; do they have any
utility?  Insofar as we follow basic directives to protect one
another, words can be useful. But at a certain point, more information
does nothing of utility; we are "locked-in" and made to follow rules.
People will just do what they do, so long as they do not get in
trouble.</p>
<p>And so, we cross streets freely when there are no cars even if it is
"jay walking" (a crime?!). What are the laws on this? Insofar as it
doesn't concern their safety, I think most people don't know.  Until I
have to renew my driver's license or something again, I won't know
either.</p>
