</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Cleaning out some stuff in my room, I noticed that I have often kept
packaging for various stuff&mdash;for instance, the original box that
came with some electronic gadget. At times, this has been helpful for
getting more resale value buying/selling used stuff, but overall it is
a space-hogging activity that doesn't do much good.</p>
<p>It was through buying and selling used stuff that I first recognized
this habit I had picked up and learned how to get over it. Usually,
buying used stuff, you <em>don't</em> get the original packaging. And I found
that this was just fine&mdash;I haven't ever really wished I had the
original packaging for anything I own.</p>
<h2>What is given?</h2>
<p>This got me thinking that indeed it is true <em>the most precious things
don't come in packages</em>. What comes in packages? Manufactured goods.
People, animals, plants, rocks&mdash;these things do not come in
packages. Nor do many human-made things. Candles, desks, shelves, and
other products of traditional crafts <em>may</em> come in packages but this
need not be so. And they certainly don't come with bar codes all the
time like computer chips do, which require unique identifiers.</p>
<h2>Tools and "Consumables"</h2>
<p>We should understand that things don't last forever, just as we don't
get infinite time to be alive on this earth. When I die, what will
happen to my stuff? Hopefully the things I have will be useful to
<em>someone</em>, so that everything I have can be put to good use. Not
having as much stuff makes things simpler for obvious reasons.</p>
