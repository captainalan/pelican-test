</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>In this post, I'll describe a phenomenon I'll call the <strong>xenophilic
paradox</strong>. This idea is this: people that are very interested in
foreign cultures often dislike or feel alienated from the place they
themselves are from&mdash;while wishing that people of the cultures
they admire do not become more cosmpolitan, they themselves contribute
to making these cultures more in their likeness.</p>
<p>For instance, you may get a linguist who is studying some
population XYZ. The linguist is most interested in talking to
monolingual speakers of XYZ and wishes to learn and understand the
culture of XYZ. However, the linguist is a foreign agent who
necessarily introduces foreign thinking/concepts/etc. upon contact.</p>
<h1>The Weeb</h1>
<p>In the West, there are lot of people that have at least a superficial
interest in places/cultures that they themselves are not ethnically
connected with. For example, there are the <strong>weebs</strong> who look fawn
after all things Japanese. Weebs cringe at each other and the Japanese
cringe at weebs. But many people continue down weebdom as a path of
escapism from their issues they refuse to confront.</p>
<p>There is a phenomenon called the <em>itasha</em> or "painful to look at car".
Do a quick image search and you will see many examples of cars
plastered with anime stuff. Why would such a thing exist?</p>
<p>The illustrator exercises control over the canvas they
control&mdash;they can establish homogeneity of style, good
composition, consistency with some standards (e.g. <em>how some character
is supposed to look</em>).</p>
<p>The weeb seeks a perfect little ordered world&mdash;even if
fictional&mdash;which illustrators can depict. Rather than meeting the
people around them, the weeb turns to some 2D ideals.</p>
<ul>
<li>They watch Naruto train instead of training themselves</li>
<li>They drool over cooking mangas while not doing the dishes in their
  own living spaces</li>
<li>They spend thousands of dollars on games, merchandise, etc. and fail
  to invest in their own futures&mdash;the prototypical <strong>consoomer</strong></li>
<li>They nostalgia LARP a childhood they never had (e.g. Japanese high
  school drama stuff)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oftentimes, the weeb is self-loathing. So why does the weeb keep on
weebing?</p>
<p>To become a weeb is easy. All you do is choose escapism over work and
let your own psychology drive you deeper and deeper into obscure places.
For some, this may be spending hours creating lewd drawings for very
specific audiences. For others, this may be becoming insufferably
boring to talk to because of having a compulsive desire to share
details about a pantheon of 2D characters to any even slightly polite
ear.</p>
<p>The weeb is able to find some beauty in the things of Japan,</p>
<ul>
<li>fine craftsmanship</li>
<li>appreciation of the natural world</li>
<li>law and order</li>
<li>ethnicity</li>
<li>arts/music celebrating simple, good things</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If only we could be like (idealized) Japan?!</em>, they wonder. Then,
they go to the voting booth and choose all the things that make them
disgusted by their own nations.</p>
<h1>Redemption of the Weeb</h1>
<p>The weeb chooses <strong>false idols</strong>&mdash;fictions made up by
men&mdash;to place first and serve. Weebness may manifest in having
shelves covered with anime figuirines, meticulously cared for,
cleaned, etc. Computers may be configured all around the <em>experience</em>
of some fictional entity.</p>
<p>Redemption of the weeb takes the same form as someone who worships
money, career/prestige, fame, etc.</p>                </article>
