</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>We can define <strong>positive thinking</strong> as actively directing one's
attention towards some goal (e.g. striving for that which is
beautiful). Positive thinking can be contrasted with <strong>reactionary
thinking</strong>&mdash; simply <em>responding</em> to bad news rather than actively
working <em>towards</em> something.</p>
<h2>Language Learning</h2>
<p>Allow me to provide an example from language learning, a topic of at
least a few posts here. Now, the goal of most language learners of
modern languages is to gain communicational competence and hopefully
"sound native" in some target language.</p>
<p>The positive thinking learner focues on <em>what being a speaker of that
target language</em> is. The most obvious way to do this is to <em>observe
the language being used</em>. Real life face-to-face conversations are
best for learning conversation, of course, but videos, podcasts, and
other forms of media are pretty good too&mdash;and often more
convenient when native speakers are readily available on a day-to-day
basis.</p>
<p>Positive thinking involves getting an increasingly clear idea of what
"using XYZ" language is. A person that does not speak Icelandic could
not give you examples of what Icelandic language usage is like because
they don't speak Icelandic.</p>
<p>What would negative thinking look like with respect to language
learning? Being focused on <em>finding one's errors</em> and then coming up
with rules and explanations for why such and such is wrong would be
one way to see this.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Some rather fatalistic viewpoints have been advanced in linguistics.
One such idea is the "critical period"&mdash;there is a certain time
window (usu. ends around age 13 or so) before which a person must
learn a language, or else they will never learn that language
"natively". This is probably true in many respects, particularly if we
involve discussion of trauma and abuse.</p>
<p>However, to tell a 16 year old high student that their Spanish <em>will
never be "native"</em> is simply demoralizing and (I think) just plain
false. Resigning to the fact that language learning will be a futile
struggle and that achieving native-like command is impossible is a
recipe to lose sight of a very reachable goal&mdash;visiting YouTube
you can find all sorts of very successful second language learners for
any major language.</p>
<h2>Computer Stuff</h2>
<p>Positive thinking is important to empower computer users as well. You
may have met someone who had simply decided, "I'm not a computer
person" or "I don't do technology". <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> This is a kind of
self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>While I don't expect everybody to be willing or able to troubleshoot
any computer problem that comes their way (and hence why I don't do
any "UNIX evangelism"), I do think certain workflows are accessible to
anyone who is capable of doing things like writing a short essay or
driving a car. It is not conceptually difficult to understand what it
means to,</p>
<ul>
<li>Send and recieve emails or messages on some chat service</li>
<li>Use some sort of calendar (e.g. Google calendar)</li>
<li>Do basic word processing/writing (e.g. through MS word, or some
  boomer program like emacs)</li>
<li>Organize files into folders</li>
</ul>
<p>Having positive (projects) such as,</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping a daily diary</li>
<li>Maintaining regular corresponce with some people/groups</li>
<li>Organizing a digital library</li>
</ul>
<p>...will inform you on the skills you need to develop.</p>
<p>Solutions often don't need to be complicated. There are professional
programers whose computers are total messes outside of their
programing projects; clearly these people know how to deal with
complexity in some one domain, but they don't readily apply tools they
already know how to use to other more accessible domains. <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
