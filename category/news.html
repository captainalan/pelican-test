</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This post is about <strong>models</strong> of the world and symbol shuffling. I will
describe how <em>words</em> act as symbols for concepts and how we our communication
with one another is limited by shared understanding of systems. This way of
looking at things answers questions like,</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is it so difficult to define words like "a", "to", "the", etc.</li>
<li>How do advertisers/politicians/etc. use "trigger words" to manage your
  feelings (and wallets)?</li>
<li>How are skills related to each other? </li>
<li>Why is it hard to learn the rules of cricket?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things and Actions</h2>
<p>You've probably heard it said that if you learn <em>any one programing language</em>,
it will be much easier to pick up a second/third/fourth/etc. Allow me spell out
in more plain terms <em>why</em> this is so.</p>
<p>Using any "general purpose" programing language, there are basic operations you
may want to do. For example, you might want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read/write files</li>
<li>Deal with clocks/time</li>
<li>Manipulate text/strings</li>
<li>Serve or request web content</li>
</ul>
<p>A person without any programing background may have some fuzzy ideas of what
these operations are, but likely understands them only in some limited context.
E.g. a file is something you can attach in Gmail, which is found somewhere on a
harddrive.</p>
<p>Learning programing means that you have to get more specific understanding of
what is involved in these operations. Learning some ("general purpose")
language for the first time means you will have to learn about these things.
Some examples of these languages are: Python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript (with Node),
and.... Common Lisp. All of these languages can do these basic things.</p>
<p>For someone who already programs in one language, learning a new programing
language is often asking "how do I do <em>action</em> XYZ in <em>language</em> ABC. It is
easy to compose a search query if you know exactly what you're looking for.
You have a base knowledge of concepts (you understand computing as a <em>system</em>)
and then you can learn the unique features and idiosyncracies of any languages
you use; you are not-relearning an entire new system with every new programing
language.</p>
<h2>Keywords and Systems</h2>
<p>Many symbols (e.g. <em>words</em> in spoken and written language) can only be
understood in the context of a system.  This is one reason why it is very hard
to usefully define "grammatical" words like prepositions, articles, and the
like.</p>
<p>Understanding any complex system means knowing how stuff "fits together".
Often times, this knowledge comes through exposure and without explanation.
Copying enough patterns, one can assimilate knowledge of these patterns and
successfully replicate them, sometimes with intentional variations.</p>
<p>Many musicians know very little "music theory" but get along just fine having a
great time with their instruments and voices. Asked to define something like
"harmonics" or whatever, many skilled musicians would be at a loss of
<em>words</em>&mdash;they could <em>show</em> you lots of things, but they couldn't say much
useful stuff explaining what they're doing in a different system (e.g. Standard
English) unless they already had some experience thinking about
teaching/learning.</p>
<p>Systems have atomic (in the sense of "indivisible") things in terms of which
other things are described. Eager beginners may want to hear explanations of
what these elementary things are (e.g. How do <em>particles</em> in Japanese work?!). 
They will likely be frustrated by the responses they get back; even with ample
explanation, they may not be able to correctly reproduce target patterns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the person that just learns a guitar strum pattern rather than going
into fancy rhythm this and that theory may soon be playing songs.</p>
<p>Assimilating knowledge of a system (and then refining that model) is ultimately
how learning of complex things happen. Trying to go very deep into
understanding little pieces <em>may</em> work eventually, but from my experience I
think that it usually doesn't. Imagine getting hung up on studying a foreign
language until you "understand" how some little grammatical word works. The
practical way forward is just to learn a whole bunch of (easy to "understand")
vocabularly and then gradually see patterns in which stuff is put together.</p>
<h2>Likeness Between Systems</h2>
<p>Insofar as systems are simialr to one another, it is not difficult to learn and
master new systems. For example, I hear the mechanics of good golf swings are
similar to hockey stick swings. Transferring concepts between these systems
means a golfer will probably more quickly learn hockey stick swinging technique
than say... a jazz pianist, all other things being equal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, learning a completely new skill (e.g. computer programing)
can be very tough because you have to assimilate a whole body of conceptual
knowledge before being able to properly order some symbols.</p>
<h2>Simplified Systems and Manipulation</h2>
<p>People use technical-sounding language to drivel on about topics all the time.</p>
<p>For example, in health/nutrition related topics, you might get someone talking
about sodium this-or-that. In what sense do they mean "sodium"? Without a more
complete understanding of chemistry/biology fundamentals, this person is trying
to use a technical sounding term <em>outside of its domain</em>. </p>
<p>Yet, doing stuff like this is often enough to win the confidence/trust of people.
If someone looks good/fit, and they mouth off utter bullshit in terms of
words/symbols, they may be accepted on <em>authority</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sounds smart and seems to work, so we can roll with that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shallow knowledge, words getting thrown around without model comprehension...
this is how powerful people manipulate fearful masses.</p>
<h3>Case Study: Condescending IT worker</h3>
<p>A Condescending IT worker may lord his esoteric computer knowledge over
customer service/marketing/etc. This person may throw around random technical
words that he <em>assumes</em> the people he is talking to don't really understand to
assert his position of being "the technical one".o</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, it is easy. We just need to migrate the ABC to the XYZ using
such-and-such fancy shmancy technology. Lol! Automation is cool. Do u
automate things?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the non-IT people the symbols this Condescending IT worker is using have
only one meaning&mdash;"I am going to use <em>a system you don't understand</em> to do
<em>a thing you are at my mercy for</em>". It is a nerd display of dominance, not an
attempt to get othe rpeople to understand the technical workings of some
system.</p>
<h3>Case Study: Esoteric interest "geek"</h3>
<p>Another character you may have met is someone who is always into <em>stuff other
than what is mainstream</em>; insufferable hipsters!</p>
<p>Rather than succeeding in some realm with well-defined systems (e.g. a
profession, mathematics, speaking a foreign language), they instead turn to
maximally esoteric things to <em>compete with nobody</em> but <em>assert their authority
on something unknown to you</em>.</p>
<p>Thing about music lady that doesn't ever play piano or guitar, but instead
makes some sounds on such-and-such ethnic instrument from a culture that is not
her own. Or consider art guy who <em>never does realistic art</em> and instead rambles
on about such-and-such theory of this-and-that.</p>
<p>These people get knowledge of some esoteric systems and then try to assert
control over you (often subtly) by lording their specialist knowledge over you
(and other "normal people" in society).</p>
<h3>Case Study: Institutional Talking Heads</h3>
<p>I introduced two sorts of "loser"ish characters here to lead gently into
discussing the more threatening force&mdash;institutionally approved talking
heads and the authority of the state, big tech, and the like.</p>
<p>These people use the same tactics, albeit more skillfully, than the
aforementioned characters.</p>
<p>In this blog, I've many times repeated the point that <em>with regards to
COVID-19, we just don't know what's going on</em>.  Yet, tons and tons of people
rose to the occasion to tell everybody else what to do based on such and such
"science" or counts of who-knows-what gathered in who-knows-how way.</p>
<p>There's lots and lots of conversation of the form,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We know what is going on. Here's a WORD to latch onto. Now, do what we say
and oppose who we tell you is the bad guy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More on tactics later.</p>                </article>
