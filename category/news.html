</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Institutionally, we're starting to see lots of "opening up" around the
world. In the United States, businesses are sending out their new
plans in e-mails/newsletters. YouTube is recommending "online therapy"
and stuff to try to keep the population <em>okay enough</em> until
locked-down times end <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. We are seeing some major signs of turning
tides with respect to policy. As for the science/biology about what is
actually going on with COVID-19, I have no idea.</p>
<p>As summer arrives in sunny California, we are seeing longer
days. Soon, people around the Northern hemisphere will be flipping on
their air conditioning units <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Maybe as the weather heats up,
people will become content with staying in (so long as finances are
taken care of)?</p>
<p>Some how, in some way, people are hanging on. Many have accepted
locked-in life as the "new normal". Others wait in anticipation for
<em>rules</em> to change and then automatically exploit any loopholes they
can to still be "well behaved" citizens <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>The Hope of Risk Free Returns</h2>
<p>In the past few months, we've seen <em>a preference for security and
risk-free returns</em>. That is, people would rather have a lock down and
keep things more "safe" rather than facing the dangerous unknown.
We're seeing a shift away from this as lock-down policies are wearing
people down.</p>
<h3>Guaranteed "Side Effects" to Avoid Possible "Main Effects"</h3>
<p>What I see happening is a general shift towards reacting to <strong>known
side-effects</strong> (economic problems), away from responding to <strong>unknown
main effects</strong> (the actual dangers of COVID-19).</p>
<p>Stopping work for a week or two is something <em>most</em> working people can
do, especially if they are still getting paid and/or can work
remotely. However, as companies have begun laying off more and more
employees (especially small businesses, who don't make enough money to
'weather the storm'), we are seeing more agitation to end lock-down
policies and "open up" society again.</p>
<p>People are feeling the real costs of lock-down. If you do things like
fasting and make doing nothing a sport (meditating), you are probably
OK during lock down. For those that don't have some kind of
"minimalism" as a hobby, times are tough.</p>
<p>Efforts to get everyone to shut up, behave, and honor essential
workers as heroes are getting tiresome as people find themselves
regulated into powerlessness.</p>
<h3>Finding Your Own Risk Free Returns</h3>
<p>My own strategy approaching the challenges of lock-in is to look for
places where my own effort input has an effect. There are many realms
where there are basically risk-free returns, e.g. doing
pushups. Assuming you don't totally overdo it, the more pushups you
do, the more fit you will become <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having projects like (1) completing reading books, (2) working through
problems/exercises, (3) establishing regular contact with
friends/family members, (4) maintaining a garden, and (5) acquiring
proficiency in a foreign language, require continued application of
concentrated efforts. The remedy for feeling like you are doing
nothing is to <em>do something</em>. </p>
<p>What I know I will see is that once all this lock-down business is
over, I will emerge as a better person in many ways because I have
dedicated myself to some projects during these trying times.</p>
<h2>The Warrior in Waiting</h2>
<p>There are many jobs where making good use of time while <em>waiting</em> is
what is most important. Firefighters and <em>samurai</em> both do not
spend most of their time putting out fires and slicing up enemies,
respectively. Rather, most of their time is spent preparing and
training so when critical encounters do happen, they are well-poised
to respond with utmost efficiency.</p>
<p>It is our turn to live the <em>way of the warrior</em> and use our time to
prepare. When lock down policies sufficiently loosen up, it will be
our turn again to apply for jobs, climb mountains, go on dates,
etc. Until then, we train like a hardworking <em>choo-choo</em> <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>
