</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Andrew Yang stopped his campaign some time around today. I was not
necessarily opposed to Yang, but was by no means an ardent supporter
either. Here's I share some thoughts about Yang's political
messages/campaign.</p>
<p>First are some impressions/observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yang campaigned hard on <strong>Universal Basic Income</strong>, $1000 bucks a
  month for pretty much all adults in a certain age range<ul>
<li>I accept Yang's point that this is probably a better
  redistribution scheme than other existing programs, layers and
  layers of bureaucracy, etc.</li>
<li>I would not like to see the government expand; it is unclear to
  me if Yang's Freedom Divident (aka <strong>NEET bux</strong>) would be
  accompanied by cutting government spending elsewhere</li>
<li>If UBI were to come to be, I'd expect a proliferation of
  subsisting people living ant-style (<em>ari-zoku</em>) for free; talk
  about danger for epidemics! A specialized class of rent-farmers
  would likely thrive too... (speculation)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yang's race/ethnicity is a whatever to me<ul>
<li>But I see you racialists out there choosing Yang just because
  he's "of color" or "Asian" just like people chose Obama for
  similar reasons</li>
<li>I think that there are both people more inclined to vote for
  Yang <em>because</em> he's Asian, and also people who would choose not
  to because of that... ...or maybe it's more about him appealing
  to the "nerd" demographic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talk of the threat of Artificial Intelligence and climate change
  without talk about populations/demographics gets the noggin' joggin'<ul>
<li>Should governments decide which groups to subsidize (and
  hence increase) at the expense of others?</li>
<li>(Insert Leftist critiques of big oil, tobacco industries, and
  related topics)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yang appears to me to be a pretty good guy, and a sincere person. In
this way, I think he has a trustworthy "feel" like Sanders. However, I
do believe his policies in general would drive America to be worse and
worse; sorry Ayn Rand brainwashed me.</p>
<h2>Dichotomous Political Opinions</h2>
<p>From the <strong>right</strong>, I like how Yang</p>
<ol>
<li>criticizes the inefficiency of government</li>
<li>has a scheme to allow capitalism, but with some safety net<ul>
<li>see how people relate UBI to "classical liberal" thought</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>rouses <strong>swamp-drainy</strong> thoughts and criticisms of the <strong>legacy
   media</strong> on the Dem side (search term <strong>yang media blackout</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p>From the <strong>left</strong>, I like how Yang</p>
<ol>
<li>Has a redistributionist scheme that <em>is more universal than
   anything we've seen before</em></li>
<li>Seems relatively peaceful, not war-hawky</li>
</ol>
<h2>Open the Third Eye; Optics and Meta-Cognitive Stuff</h2>
<p>I dislike the 'MATH' campaign thing and all that nerd stuff; I see
that Yang is a lawyer too, not an engineer or even a veteran
(C.f. Tulsi Gabbard) so I suspect how "in touch" with reality he is on
the physics of the world. Math is wallowing in abstractions; how does
this map to reality?</p>
<p>This doesn't matter to most people who just clamour against "CLIMATE
CHANGE" and view they have "SCIENCE" on their side without
understanding a thing about it, besides what they've heard, akin to
how most people accept the traditions/religions handed to them.
(<strong>Note</strong>: I'm not denying climate change or criticizing
traditions/religions here, I'm just making a point about how people
accept/reject ideas presented to them...)</p>
<h2>The memes were with him...</h2>
<p>(...but many were probably by top-down design)</p>
<p>In any case, I hope that this whole Yang ordeal encoruages people to
criticially evaluate the sources they get any information from.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I cite nothing and just say my impressions. No fake
news here. Just opinions. Is your news just opinions too?</p>                </article>
