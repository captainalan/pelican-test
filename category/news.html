</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Fundamentally, what a <strong>business</strong> does is exchange some good or service for
some form of payment. So if you buy a chair for $30, you give the business $30
somehow and then they get a chair to you, somehow. Business can of course be
more <em>abstract/complex</em>. Insurance, for instance, has deals where you pay some
(hopefully) small-ish agreed upon amount at regular intervals. The insurance
company will then give you large sums of money in the case of whatever events
you are buying insurance for come to pass&mdash;e.g. a forest fire, theft, etc.
That is of course, how stuff is <em>supposed</em> to work by the textbook.</p>
<h2>Essentials</h2>
<p>"Normal expenses" include things like groceries, clothes, and tools for work. </p>
<p>But life has gotten more complicated in the modern era. Using some kind of
<strong>credit</strong> is extremely common&mdash;people go into debt for daily purchases
with credit cards as well as get into complex payment plans for bigger things
like homes and cars.</p>
<p>It is quite "expensive" to live&mdash;that's why we have this term
"<strong>affordability</strong>" or even "<strong>livability</strong>" to talk about how in some places,
you can work <em>reasonable</em> hours and earn enough money to pay your expenses and
still have time to do other things versus other places where you might work 3
part time jobs and sleep for 4 hours each night to barely get by.</p>
<p>"Everyday business" involves what you practically need to get by
day-to-day&mdash;food/water, clothing, and shelter. Then, there's everything else.</p>
<h2>Creating Demand Creates Business</h2>
<p>Beyond food/water, clothing, and shelter, there is <em>everything else</em>. This is
where most of the money in the world is. Day by day, most people take care of
"everyday business" stuff in one way or another&mdash;this could mean living in
a tent, getting free Costco samples, and wearing the same clothes for three
decades. Yet, all the <em>essentials</em> are met. This is not dating advice.</p>
<p>So people begin to produce things that go <em>beyond the basics</em>. Any large city
will have many foods&mdash;not just to allow you to stay alive but to draw you
in with artistic arrangements, various combinations of ingredients, and
ingredients like salt and oil that can make nearly any product of the earth
taste rich. People will rent land/office space and provide various
services&mdash;whether it is a barber shop giving haircuts or an ice skating
rink, you can exchange payment for people to give you access to things you
can't or won't do yourself.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we're still talking about fine and honest business.</p>
<h3>Fear</h3>
<p>Where business gets bad is when it begins <em>preying</em> upon "customers" to create
more demand. You can say that businesses that do this fail the "vibe
check"&mdash;they add more negativity to the air without offering additional
help, drawing in more money through harmful messaging.</p>
<p>The past year, 2020, has been super-charged by fear-based business. People will
purchase additional security (like cameras to monitor their homes), protective
equipment, and arrange the structure of their lives to <em>avoid risk</em>&mdash;at
least this is the selling point.</p>
<p>Note that "fear is contagious"; so if one person is afraid of something (e.g. a
darkmatter wave perturbation thingy) then suddenly others will begin to feel
they too are <em>licensed to fear</em> this same thing. In modern jargon, we call this
"<strong>raising awareness</strong>'.</p>
<p>So I might "raise awareness" of anti-Alan discrimination by making all sorts of
posts all over social media so that other people too can be afraid of anti-Alan
discrimination and help spread my message. Maybe they'll even buy a T-Shirt or
something from me.</p>
<h3>Coersion</h3>
<p>Some "businesses" you have to interface with whether you want to or not, albeit
indirectly. This is where <em>taxation</em> comes in. Governments dish out tons of
money all over the place, and you often have little to no say in what's going
on.</p>
<p>I would put <em>compulsory</em> education in this category; we're forced to pay for
schools whether we like what they're doing or not. Nobody is really against
"education" in the real sense of teaching people how to do useful stuff. </p>
<p>But what's happened little by little is that terms like "education" become
equated with particular instantiations/institutions such that if you oppose
some group&mdash;like a union&mdash;you will likely be branded as
"anti-education" and called mean names like a Luddite Dummy-head.</p>
<p>Other forms of profiting off of coersion come from making money off of
mandatory training, licensing, and regulating. Here, you don't really "make/do"
anything&mdash;you're in the business of getting people in trouble.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there isn't a real need for regulation. I've read my
Ayn Rand and I'm not one of these "anarcho-capitalist" types. The issue is
whether the regulators and regulations are doing what they're supposed to do or
if they are simply getting in the way of good, honest business.</p>
<p>In 2020, many small businesses had to shut down. Rules related to the Big Coof
(TM) meant that restaurants had to change much of how they operated and put a
lot of space to waste&mdash;chairs stacked on tables in empty restaurants... </p>
<p>Business owners were required by law to follow these guidelines. Breaking rules
of course <em>is</em> possible, but you might get in trouble especially if you're
surrounded by snitches.</p>
<p>I'm sure some businesses profited greatly from this all&mdash;many probably
popped up just to meet new manufactured needs. You can see scores of
"designer/fashion" masks, fancy COVID this-and-that posters, etc. None of this
was "free"&mdash;people got paid handsomely to perpetuate this narrative.</p>
<h3>Scams/Fraud</h3>
<p>What I'll call a <strong>scam</strong> is a business built off of a model of a <em>fake problem</em>.
If I tell you that you have some illness which you don't have and then convince
you to pay me a lot of money for a product that does nothing, all I've done is
lie and deceive to make my quick buck. This is a scam/fraud.</p>
<p>Ask yourself&mdash;do you think scam/fraud can occur at scale, even by our
"sacred" institutions? Do shiny advertisements and snappy websites <em>prove</em>
anything beyond lots of money spent?</p>
<h2>Problems will present themselves to you</h2>
<p>If you have a tooth ache, I don't need to tell you that <em>you should visit the
dentist</em>. Someone with a tooth ache will most likely start seeking out options
themselves to a problem they know they have. "My tooth is hurting and it is
distracting me from other things I need to give my attention to!"</p>
<p>A lot of media is in the business of telling you about <em>problems you didn't
know you had</em>. One might call this <em>meddling in business that is not your own</em>.
Who does it profit to get enraged about issue XYZ when you are not in a
position to do anything about it?</p>
<p>And the activist replies, "Oh, but <em>you can</em> do something about it. Give my NGO
money and help spread awareness".</p>
