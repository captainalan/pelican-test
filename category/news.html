<h2>Oscillating between different activities</h2>
<p>I try something for a while, for instance solving some problem or
reading a chapter of a book. Sooner or later, it will become too
boring/difficult to continue. So, I'll switch to another activity that
I think I should be doing. Repeatedly cycling through different
activities I should be doing, I end up "clocking in" lots of time
doing productive stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Workout (e.g. pushup sets, crunches)</li>
<li>Foreign language study (e.g. read some news in Chinese, review some
  Spanish grammar)</li>
<li>Fuss with some Linux config</li>
<li>Browse over the documentation for some programing language (mostly
  Node, Golang, bash these days)</li>
<li>Try to solve some fussy CSS problem </li>
<li>Writing blog posts (like this one)</li>
<li>Playing some <em>Étude</em> on some musical instrument</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the individual activities above often is not the most fun
thing in the world to do. But the variety of being able to cycle
through them means lots of little sessions of intense focus. I lower
my expectations for myself by only expecting to concentrate for like
20 minutes at a time. Workout bursts are even shorter.</p>
<p>By sundown I'm usually adequately tired (or interested in something)
that I don't need to ask myself about what to do next. If I feel like
sleeping at 9 PM, sure, I'll go to sleep. If I wanna stay up reading
about how Arab Nationalism didn't work, sure I'll go do that.</p>
<h2>Welcomed Interruptions</h2>
<p>Punctuating the above routine with sending/receiving a message or two,
looking at the whatever noise I heard outside, flipping through some
book, etc. keeps me feeling "in the loop".</p>
<p>Something something <em>flow like water</em> uhh... zen... yeah!</p>
