</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Talk about how information technology works is often cast in mystical
terms for the "uninitiated". For example, we're often told about these
things called <strong>"algorithms"</strong> that will replace jobs, protect
national security/privacy, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>We should frame these things in simpler, more transparent terms. All
an "algorithm" is is a set of instructions for computers. When we talk
about "losing jobs to AI", this means <em>people</em> choosing to take humans
out of processes and replace them with machines and then letting
machines handle decision making.</p>
<p>For example, instead of having a receptionist, a business might choose
to have a generic program with a bunch of prompts/menus the user has
to navigate through. <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> The precursor to a system like this might be
to have receptionists <em>follow some script</em> obeying rules rather than
using their brains to help customers solve actual problems.</p>
<p>Search engines are similar. You can think of them as a "librarian
program". You can ask this AI thing for some information (using a
<code>search query</code>) and it will return some result.</p>
<p>This process is <strong>opaque</strong>&mdash;it is a <strong>black box</strong> you cannot look
into and study directly. Google does what Google will do.</p>
<h2>An Exmaple Algorithm</h2>
<p>Let's try to dress things up to look fancy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">special_topics</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;federal reserve&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;tech censorship&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;9-11 conspiracy&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="p">];</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">search</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nx">special_topics</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">special_topics</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">search</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Use default procedure</span>
    <span class="nx">normalSearchRoutine</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this <strong>code</strong> (another word people will use to cloak their
activities in mysticism), we return <em>one type of result</em> for certain
topics and other types of results for other topics.</p>
<p>The user will approach the search engine and not know how this
works&mdash;they just enter a <code>query</code> and <em>trust</em> the results.</p>
<h2>Taking your Job</h2>
<p>This is what many of the "algorithms" of big tech are doing. The game
plan is,</p>
<ol>
<li>Take some human job, and make it mechanical/codified (like how a
   call center worker may be made to read a script)</li>
<li>Slowly reduce human agency, involvement in these processes. You
   might have a system that only has a human to sign off something at
   the last step, but the rest of the process proceeds without any
   human needing to know/trust another human.</li>
<li>Entirely eliminate humans, reducing the complexity of jobs that
   need to be done if necessary&mdash;rather than offering custom
   jobs, offer a configuration of a handful of options</li>
<li>Collect data, tweak the algorithms, and try to <em>optimize</em> human
   interaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>What a bunch of anti-social nerds.o</p>
<p>Many areas of work still must be done with human hands. But we can
expect with more IoT (Internet of Things) technology, robots, drones,
and more that more and more sectors will be attacked.</p>
<p>Consider,</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital music playback (with holograms?!??) over live performance</li>
<li>self-checkout at stores</li>
<li>streaming services</li>
<li>mass-produced goods (often <em>not user servicable</em>)</li>
<li>public education&mdash;textbooks and standardized materials</li>
<li>Apple devices (vs building and configuring your own PC)</li>
<li>tract homes</li>
<li>fast food</li>
</ul>
<p>In every case above, you can observe the same general pattern.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>Exercise your <strong>agency</strong> and take control of what you can. Understand
<em>your role</em> in turning over stuff to "algorithms" and consider
carefully if adapting some new technology actually makes things any
better.</p>
<p>This is not an anti-technology post&mdash;indeed I'm writing this from
a computer and publishing it to the Internet!</p>
<p>Rather, this is a reminder that tools should remain tools. And we
should make tools useful to us (humans) rather than shaping our habits
to fit them. You are more than a "cog in the system". You are an
individual and you do not have to <em>try to be unique</em> by flipping the
switches to configure a "profile" for some algorithm to process and
nerds to data perv at.</p>
