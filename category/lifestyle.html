</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>In various places on the Internet, I have shared the story of how I
switched from typing using the standard QWERTY layout to using the
alternative, more efficient Dvorak layout. However, after using Dvorak
for some time, working my typing speed to over 100 WPM, I ultimately
chose to <em>switch back to QWERTY</em> (more on my experience
<a href="https://haksayng.com/blog/2017/08/14/relearning-totype/">here</a>).
Why would anyone re-learn how to type twice<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>?</p>
<p>The main reasons I had for doing this were,</p>
<ol>
<li>compatibility with the world at large (I had to help other people
   use their computers), and</li>
<li>the gains/advantages I got from switching to an alternative
   keyboard layout came mainly from improved typing technique rather
   than a "better layout".</li>
<li>issues interfacing with software designed for a QWERTY-based
   windows, such as shortcuts keys in games/graphics applications/etc<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great Internet Historian <a href="http://xahlee.info/">Xah Lee</a> has called my
default-embracing ways <strong>QWERTY Theory</strong>. I like this label because
"theory" implies it is <em>not just about keyboards</em>. It is an approach
to technology generally which advocates <em>making the best use of
commonly available default options, focusing on improving technique
rather than exploiting customization</em>.</p>
<p>This article will detail what QWERTY Theory is and isn't and how it
can help you make a million bucks. Let's get started!</p>
<h2>Thou Shalt Not Covet</h2>
<p>QWERTY Theory inherits from a Judeo-Christian moral framework.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your
neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or
anything that belongs to your neighbor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Exodus 20:17</p>
<p>We begin with the axiom: the basic tools you have in front of you are
good enough. Avert your eyes from the fancy-things others possess and
meditate upon how you can do better with what you already have to face
whatever issues are in front of you.</p>
<p>Some applications,</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing more sustainable typing habits by training new muscle
  memory to hit default key bindings (e.g. pressing the CTRL key with
  your <em>thumbs</em> rather than pinkies<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>)</li>
<li>Doing physical training using simple or no equipment (e.g. dumbells
  you already have) rather than signing up for a fancy gym, buying an
  expensive new machine, etc.</li>
<li>Practicing more on your $200 guitar instead of looking at ads for a
  $2000 guitar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time may come to upgrade your tools, but for now think about what
you <em>can</em> do, envisioning how you can use the tools you have better.
QWERTY Theory is about pursuing mastery of the mundane, focusing on
building upon rather than inverting tradition.</p>
<h2>Know Thyself</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes
wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;Proverbs 11:2 (NIV)</p>
<p>QWERTY theory is suitable for non-geniuses who want to be productive
with existing infrastructure. Chances are, you are <em>not</em> going to be
<em>the chosen one</em> who is going to revolutionize computer input devices
<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. Therefore, it is important to be able to work effectively with
standard setups.</p>
<p>It may at first seem "efficient" to optimize things like keyboard
entry speed, but there are many "hidden costs" that come with every
deviation from the
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software">vanilla</a>".</p>
<p>Custom configurations of software often amounts to demanding special
attention that should be reserved for disabled people who have no
other choice but to use speialized setups. QWERTY theory says to not
<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=LARP">LARP</a> as being
an oppressed class because being a nerd is a not a disability <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Case Study: Fahrenheit vs Celsius</h2>
<p>Advocates of alternative ways of doing things (e.g. typing in Dvorak
versus QWERTY) often claim some "scientific" basis for why their way
of doing things is superior. Oftentimes, further inspection reveals
nonsense.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the claim that "using Celsius is more
<em>scientific</em> than using Fahrenheit". Someone
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_(contemporary_subculture)">hipster</a>
living in the United States may go around using Celsius and causing
trouble for everyone around them. Is Celsius really <em>better</em> than
Fahrenheit?</p>
<p>When looking at <em>whole integer</em> values (e.g. 85 degrees F), Fahrenheit
has better resolution than Celsius. This is relevant because sometimes
displays will only allow two or three digits, or only show integer
temperatures rather than crowd the UI with a decimal. If some
numb-skull tells you that Celsius is more "scientific" than
Fahrenheit, just tell them that Celsius and Fahrenheit are both linear
transformations off Kelvin and that you aren't living at sea level and
boiling water there (situation used to determine Celsius' offset from
Kelvin).</p>
<p>A better reason to use Celsius over Fahrenheit is because Celsius is a
more widely adopted in the world at large; QWERTY Theory! It is not
because Celsius "is more scientific" or some bullshit like that.
It is to fall into line with convention.</p>
<h2>Scope Resolution</h2>
<p>Depending on who/what we want to engage with in the world, the
<strong>scope</strong> in which we evaluate what the QWERTY Theory approved choice
is changes. For instance, if you intend to spend your whole life in
the United States doing business almost exclusively with fellow
Americans, then it makes sense to use Fahrenheit all the
time. However, if you are a global traveler, then you must use a more
global <strong>scope resolution</strong> strategy to choose what a good "default"
is. It may be more practical to you to mainly use Celsius, converting
to Fahrenheit only when necessary, even for someone living in the
United States. In this sense, the <em>globalist</em> may want the US to adopt
the metric system, celsius, etc. to conform with global standards.</p>
<p>Analogous reasoning can be applied to setting up computing
environments.  If you just stay on only one or two of your own
computers and do your own thing all day (e.g. living in a cabin in the
woods), then your <em>scope</em> may be just you and what you do. QWERTY
Theory doesn't mean much to you.</p>
<p>However, if you work in tech support or have friends/family members
around you who also use computers, then suddenly it matters more that
you understand the general computing environments that most people
find themselves in. That is to say, it might be a good idea to have a
Windows machine even if you prefer to do most stuff on Linux yourself.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Many nerds eventually repent and turn away from their alt-keyboard
fetishizing, returning to their QWERTYc roots. In "<a href="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/porn_zen_and_vimrc/">Porn, Zen, and
.vimrc</a>"
(Koncevičius ) we see a heartfelt confession of an over-config'er (in
this case, someone who dived deeply into customizing the <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim text
editor</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...implemented defaults and design was there for a reason. Some of
my perceived inconsistencies were products of my limited
understanding. I made assumptions about what a particular command
should do, when it should be used, and how. But those assumptions
were not always warranted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>QWERTY Theory is about embracing the fact that the shapes technologies
around us have taken have survived and thrived for reasons we may not
immediately understand. Properties may arise that were no individuals'
"original design" but are rather products of processes of
collaboration. </p>
<p>QWERTY theory protects against the "efficient inefficiency" of
assuming you are more clever than all sorts of people in the past
because you discovered some quick "hack" to optimize something in your
life <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>QWERTY Theory is seeing that the "illogical" nature of English
spelling is necessarily "stupid"; there is no need to rush to
<em>optimize English spelling to be more phonetic</em>. Who assumed a more
phonetic writing system is <em>better?</em> Perhaps, we should speak more
like how we write instead of writing more like we speak?</p>
<p>QWERTY Theory is leveraging existing systems, improving technique, and
preparing for full-scale change rather than pre-maturely optimizing
unwieldy channels.</p>
