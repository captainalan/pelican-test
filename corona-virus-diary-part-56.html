</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In the city I grew up in, there were many unfamiliar symbols all
around me. Though I am of Chinese heritage, I did not learn Chinese
until I decided to do so myself as an "adult learner". So, returning to
places I spent time in as I grew up living with my parents, my
surroundings have become <em>literally</em> more readable to me now.</p>
<p>There is often a fairly big "barrier to entry" to learn how to read
some new script. Particularly in the case of languages like Chinese or
Japanese, you have to learn to recognize unfamilar forms and associate
those forms with unfamiliar sounds. Once you pass the initial barrier
of getting started, however, you open up the floodgates to learn a
whole lot very quickly.</p>
<h2>Living in a bilingual dictionary</h2>
<p>I don't spend very much time at all actively studying Spanish.
However, just by living in California and taking the time to try to
decipher bits and pieces of written Spanish (materials/signs/etc. are
often translated), I feel pretty comfortable in (formal) Spanish.</p>
<p>Other parts of the world have different sets of languages. In East
Asia, it is easy to study at once Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
because in major cities where tourists are likely to be you will often
see information presented in all three of these languages plus
English.</p>
<p>If you learn the basics of reading some other script and also know how
to look up unfamiliar words (whether on your phone or using paper
resources), you can quickly learn lots of vocabulary with very little
effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>시작이 반 이다.<br>
Starting is half the battle</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>An anecdote</h3>
<p>Let me share with you how I began learning Korean. Growing up through
grade school, I had many classmates of Korean ethnicity. One day, I
got bored in class, so I asked a classmate to show me how the Korean
writing system worked.</p>
<p>I got very interested because I liked how Korean sounded and looked
and found Korean people pretty interesting too (they acted with
<em>intensity</em>). Stashed away somewhere, I probably still have some of
the scraps of paper I used in those days I first started studying
Korean.</p>
<p>Now, in 2020, lots of "Korean" content is popular globally. I would
like to say that I started learning Korean "before it was cool". I
don't actually really care much for current Korean music, movies, etc.
(if I consoomed anything, it would be from decades past; 아저씨 처럼
나 옛날을 기억해).</p>
<p>Learning to read and speak some Korean fairly early on in my life has
enabled me to not over-romanticize or chase Korean things <em>just
because they are foreign</em>; Korean stuff in fact feels more familiar to
me than weird stuff like the American Top 40 chart.</p>
<h2>Code Switching</h2>
<p>Linguists have this term "<strong>code switching</strong>" for when people drop in
words/phrases/etc. in another language. For example, I might say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday's test was <em>no bueno</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bird pooped on my head. Am I angry? <em>C'est la vie.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This too is a means by which people can become familar with lots of
foreign language stuff.</p>
<p>As much as it pains me to say, there are many weebs on the Internet
who are familiar with a fairly large number of Japanese words and
phrases from anime. From <em>sensei</em> to <em>senpai</em>, meme shitposting
netizens all over the globe are making Japanese a kind of <em>lingua
franca</em> of Internet weebdom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>おまえはもう死んでいる<br>
Omae wa mou shinde iru.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The multilingual blog</h2>
<p>Overall, I think that is a good idea to <em>preserve standard orthography
when possible</em> as well as provide any <em>helpful information for
reading/interpreting foreign language words and phrases</em>. That is why
for all the alphabet languages (including Korean) in this post I have
just used standard orthography. Anyone that cares enough about the
specifics to learn Korean can easily look stuff up.</p>
<p>For languages like Chinese and Japanese where you can't learn the
script so easily, it is helpful to have some kind of phonetic gloss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>你看得懂没有？<br>
Nǐ kàn-de-dǒng méiyǒu?<br>
Can you understand what you are reading?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can type all sorts of languages without setting up anything fancy
on your computer using <a href="https://www.google.com/inputtools/try/">Google Input
Tools</a>.</p>
<p>I think this way of doing things is preferable over trying to invent
ad-hoc Romanization systems (or even using established, but not widely
known systems) <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. There can be lots of confusion over different
transliterations, so presenting some foreign language stuff <em>only in
transliteration</em> can lead to potential corruption of meaning/intent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, preserving standard orthography means that it will
be easy for people that do want to find out more to find out more to
do so. If you're feeling generous, providing helpful information to
language learners is a considerate to thing too! <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<h2>Challenge for English speaking natives</h2>
<p>If you haven't done so already, it probably won't take long to learn
the basics of reading French and German words. Here's two strategies
you can learn to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA); this isn't an
  obscure thing&mdash;it is used all over Wikipedia, for instance, to
  describe how to pronounce names of things</li>
<li>Watch some introductory YouTube videos reading words in French/German</li>
</ul>
<p>I have never met anyone who has learned these things and thought it
was a waste of time.</p>
