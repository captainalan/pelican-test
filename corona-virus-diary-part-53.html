</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It has been a while since I've checked tech news, so I visited <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker
News</a> this morning to see what's going
on the minds of the computer nerds. I looked over one article going
over how Amazon's Kindle devices collect a "surprisingly large amoung
of data". Various other articles concerned details of various
technologies that wouldn't be of interest to general audiences.
Hacker News is associated with venture capital stuff, so there were a
handful of articles related to funding/finance.</p>
<h2>People of the Bubble</h2>
<p>For many nerds, life goes on pretty much as normal during covid <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.
Sure, you might have to wear a mask, but many nerds would probably
have preferred to hide behind a mask anyways, so now they can
simultaneous <em>virtue signal</em> and conceal their smirks of disdain at
all the "idiots" around them acting less straight-laced than themselves.</p>
<p>Going around town, I can see that many people are doing their best
to cooperate with authorities and do a good, honest job wherever they
are. Every interaction I have had with store employees has been
pleasant; no troubles. </p>
<p>From inside my bubble, things like OK logistically. The stock market
has had just... ridiculous prices. I haven heard anyone talk about
bitcoin being a bubble recently, lol.</p>
<h2>Bubble Bursting</h2>
<p>What I am describing are relatively peaceful parts of a relatively
nice part of California; other cities (e.g. Portland, New York
City...) are recieving a lot more... action.</p>
<p>I am assuming most people around me are employed in some way or
otherwise have the resources to not face fear of eviction. Major
employers in my vicinity include various government agencies and
hospitals. In other words, I am surrounded by very institutionally
embedded people as well as "normal" businesses like restaurants, gas
stations, laundromats, and the like.</p>
<p>Poking around the Internets, I know that many people <em>are not doing
well at all</em>. Probably lots of the people I'm connected with on social
media aren't going out so much&mdash;the relatively pleasant
interactions I've had with people outside represent,</p>
<ul>
<li>Go-getters trying to improve themselves (e.g. seeing people while
  exercising outside)</li>
<li>People with jobs (and thus taking care of at least some things
  financially)</li>
<li>People that <em>want</em> to interact with the outside world</li>
</ul>
<h2>Predictions</h2>
<p>I don't think that we're going to see a "return to normal" anytime
soon in the sense that over the next few months we're going to see
lots of lasting changes. <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Many dystopian trends we're seeing in
the USA have been here for... a long time. one might say they are
baked into the foundations of this nation. With changes in technology
and the expansion of the Internet into more and more places I think we
can expect,</p>
<ul>
<li>More surveillance, everywhere. The more things that are hooked up to
  smart phones and/or the Internet, the more data we will generate</li>
<li>Further consolidation of power for financial/technochratic elites.
  These people <em>are not independent of government</em> (so don't try some
  lame "muh free markets!" argument) <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Further erosion of constitutional rights (e.g. right to assemble,
  right to bear arms) <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></li>
<li>Many people will be trapped out alone, isolated&mdash;consider for
  example recent college graduates who have maintained employment in a
  new city; they may opt to continue living in that new city despite
  the remnants social life continuing to waste away</li>
<li>Drawn out indecisiveness; most people don't want to get in trouble
  breaking the law and the current way stuff is laid out, it is
  difficult to move fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>I made <a href="https://captainalan.github.io/pelican-test/corona-virus-diary-part-6.html">some
predictions</a>
about covid stuff back in May of this year). Overall my predictions
moving forward are more grim, but not in contradition with those made
earlier.</p>
<p>Some more predictions for the coming months,</p>
<ul>
<li>America as a whole will continue to drift "blue"/Democrat;
  Californians will leave California and bring their politics where
  they go.</li>
<li>If Trump wins, he may be our last Republican president for a long
  time (or ever); we can expect massive media
  outrage/scandal/rioting/etc if Trump wins</li>
<li>If Biden wins, I expect to see a short-term "return to prosperity".
  This might mean covid mysteriously "ending" or some vaccine being
  rolled out. What will follow is increased socialism, surveillance,
  and everything inbetween&mdash;basically leading the USA towards a
  totalitarian secular state. <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup></li>
<li>We will see more rioting in US cities</li>
<li>We may see the formation of new police-like forces by "community
  organizers"</li>
<li>I do not think we will see a large, unified "right wing" defense; we
  will see small, local efforts, but nothing like a large militia
  fighting off protestors, at least in the coming few months.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think many of the businesses that have survived this far will
continue to survive; tech companies, banks, etc. will also continue to
consolidate power.</p>
<h2>Preparing for the future</h2>
<p>There is no better time than now to make peace with those around you,
build/maintain your networks, and work on yourself than now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Landowners&mdash;what do you think a nation of broke millennials
  will vote in?</li>
<li>Renters&mdash;do not squander your time/resources on things that may
  not be there tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<p>Connections, skills, and of course good character will take you far
<em>in any world</em>. The world we are heading into will not be the "Boomer
economy" those before us have known.</p>

<p>I'm not even going to bother capitalizing/typesetting "COVID-19"

<p>As communists will point out, capitalism is useful for building
up infrastructure, wealth, etc. Depending which sort of communist
you're talking to, this wealth generated by creative energy can
then be controlled through monopoly and the monopoly can be
collectived, or something like that.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>Note, I am not one of these people who believe the Constitution
is a moral/binding document. It requires a certain sort of society
to work in and if the population of the US is collectively
deciding against protecting individual freedoms, we can expect to
see them disappear. I'm sure you can find some quotes about
defending liberty this-and-that from some founding father people
if you do some searching.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:6">
<p>Or you can follow some kinda hippy, new-age "all is one"
religion. But there won't be "religious freedom" like how many
people still think of it; consider what you may have heard about
"Christians being persecuted in China". I think we can expect a
similar situtation developing in the US; indeed during covid,
freedom to assemble has already been restricted for a long time&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
