</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today's topic is <em>making progress learning technical skills</em>. By
"technical" here I am talking about skills where there is a clear,
measurable way to tell how some result is <em>better</em> or <em>worse</em>.</p>
<p>For instance, drawing realistically&mdash;or emulating the style of a
particular artist&mdash;may be viewed as a technical skill. On the
other hand, evaluate "are these blog posts getting <em>better?</em>" is not
so easy <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.  Technical skills are vital for creative expression
because they are the vehicle by which you can form and express
ideas. Weak technical skills means weak expressive capacity!</p>
<p>Here, I will introduce some ideas I have useful and give examples of
how I have applied these ideas. In this way, I will give a kind of
journal of some of successes and failures and remind myself of what
has(n't) worked for me; maybe it will be useful to you too or at least
fun to read ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<h2>First, have projects</h2>
<p>"Projects" are some concrete goal you can work toward <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Some projects
are very-well defined. For example, you may have goals to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pay of student debt</li>
<li>Produce a painting a week for a year</li>
<li>Learn German to a conversational level before visiting Germany</li>
<li>Build a website for a friend</li>
<li>Re-establish contact with at least four friends over the next month</li>
</ul>
<p>Other things may be more abstract. Though, I think that if you can
<em>visualize</em> it, it can be a project. Can you imagine the "conditions
of success" for your project?</p>
<ul>
<li>Feel comfortable talking about XYZ&mdash;you probably have at least
  <em>something</em> you feel comfortable talking about, e.g. your pet
  cat. You can therefore conceptualize what it might <em>look</em> like to be
  able to talk about some topic comfortably. You can see examples of
  people doing such-and-such on YouTube and visualize yourself doing
  the same</li>
<li>Improve your relationship with some family member/mutual
  acquaintance/etc.&mdash;you may not know exactly how this will look
  with such-and-such particular person you are going to have to spend
  some time with, but you may have positive examples of working
  relationships to turn to as inspiration for how stuff might work out</li>
<li><em>Learn to Code</em>&mdash;what does this even mean? You can measure your
  success on this based on your ability to make a project of XYZ scale
  or go through ABC cirriculum.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having projects is important because they give you something to align
your efforts with. Broad projects, get broken up into small
sub-tasks&mdash;such as doing math problems everyday towards a broader
project goal of "achieving basic mathematic proficiency". Looking at
your own activities in relation to projects means you can evaluate if
what you're currently doing is moving you towards or away from your
goals. You may find that getting
<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shwasted">shwasted</a>
on Friday night is not conducive to "finding peace and happiness with
a stable family"&mdash;your time may be better spent doing activities
that will earn you money, improve your health, etc.</p>
<p>Note that many people naturally excel at creating projects for
themselves on-the-fly. For example, a person naturally interested in
anime may set themselves over completing many "goals" of studying
Japanese by compulsively watching through lots of anime series,
investing effort to take notes of new vocabulary and such as they
go. This <em>hataraki-mono</em> ("hardworking") weeb may succeed gloriously
at learning Japanese quickly and efficiently because little planning
is needed&mdash;interest drives serial "project creation".</p>
<p>I write about explicitly selecting and choosing projects because one
of my problems is that I start way too many different projects and
"spread my efforts too thin". By explicitly figuring out what my
projects are and keeping inventory, I can better select which projects
<em>don't</em> need my attention and turn my efforts towards the goals most
important to me.</p>
<h3>Coming up with projects</h3>
<p>Getting started with a new project can be daunting, but also lots of
fun. It may mean you get to take a shopping trip, set up a new
calendar where you plot and scheme your road to glory...</p>
<p>It may also be useful to re-think activities that you are already
doing in the context of "projects" if you have hit a plateau in
progress and are not satisfied with how things are currently (not)
improving.</p>
<p>Here are some ways you can establish new projects or "cast" things you
are already doing into projects.</p>
<h4>Work through a comprehensive resource</h4>
<p>Textbooks can be very helpful. Undergraduate classes I've taken have
rarely gotten through an <em>entire</em> textbook. So if there was some
subject that you would like to learn about (e.g. biology) picking up a
book on such-and-such subject and working through <em>all the chapters</em>
can be a fine way to get a comprehensive, "canonical" understanding of
any given subject.</p>
<p>You may want to re-work through the fundamentals of something you
already know how to do. For instance, I already know some basic of
reading music, but I kind of suck at playing piano. To get better, I
acquired some easy-ish classical music. By working seriously (as an
adult learner) through training materials I can improve.
Playing through <em>every</em> piece in such-and-such book may help me
improve on areas I am weak in (e.g. playing complex rhythms) even if
these pieces aren't as "fun" at first because I suck at playing them.</p>
<p>Working through a comprehensive resource will help you find what you
are good at and what you are not so good at and give you obvious 
areas to "flag for improvement".</p>
<h4>Build something</h4>
<p>When you try to build something rather than just solve some
pre-prepared problem you will soon discover what you have to study and
what skills you lack.</p>
<p>For example, it is easy to passively "study" a foreign every language
by playing some songs in that language. Sooner or later, you may just
listen to that music passively, zoning out and doing other stuff while
learning zero Spanish (or whatever language you happen to be
studying).</p>
<p>What you may want to do is <em>build</em> a repertoire of songs/lyrics you
actually <em>have memorized</em>. This will involve picking and choosing
songs that are meaningful enough to you that they are worth studying.
In doing this, you will likely come across idioms that surprise you,
words you find you didn't know, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Other examples of building stuff include,</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a finished work of art&mdash;not just quick, fast sketches,
  but a painting that will take you many days (or even weeks, months)</li>
<li>Establish a nexus of communication for you and
  friends/family&mdash;e.g. create a Discord server and input your own
  content there everyday for a month to get activity buzzing;
  personally invite/promote your project</li>
<li>Configuring Linux to your liking from a relatively basic
  setup&mdash;may be a pain in the butt, but you will learn a lot
  about how stuff is clobbled together to produce a decent "user
  experience"</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes building is just putting in the blood/sweat/tears needed to
get something done. This can be more refreshing than wallowing around
in indirection sometimes even if it is difficult in another way.</p>
<p>However, other times you may be pleasantly surprised at how <em>little</em>
work you have to do to build something nice&mdash;this may be because
you find ways in which you can bring other people into your
project(s).  Projects involving others may gain a life of their own
and continue organically grow.</p>
<p>Having a knack for getting projects started, putting in concentrated
effort, and then seeing stuff just kinda... work out is called <em>being
enterprising</em>. Fantastic! You can then choose to stay involved with
your own project or hand off (or sell) your "startup" to some other
party.</p>
<h4>Optimize some metric</h4>
<p>Another class of projects is <em>making some number go up/down</em>. For
instance, you may have a goal of running three miles in under 30
minutes. Metrics are good because you can measure your progress.</p>
<p>However, metrics can be bad because they can be misleading on
measuring what you're really interested in. For instance, you might be
measuring your body <em>weight</em> but be more interested in feeling healthy
overall.</p>
<h4>Let somebody else give you a project</h4>
<p>Not everybody has to be a "leader"; choosing to follow people whose
goals align with your own can be a shortcut to a life well-lived.</p>
<p>Having a good teacher/coach/manager can be very helpful because it
means someone who has seen more of some domain than you can guide you
to make faster progress than you could on your own.</p>
<p>Letting somebody else assign you projects, and following their
directives is also a fine way to occupy one's time productively
towards ends that at least someone else cares about.</p>
<h2>Work on your projects frequently</h2>
<p>For some people, the easiest way to ensure frequent work on projects
is a schedule. Others hate schedules and still get a lot
done. Typically, the more projects you will have the more sort of
structure you'll need to continue making progress at all of them.
If you only care about doing one or two things well, your whole life
can take shape around doing these things without much planning.</p>
<p>Personally, having <em>too many projects</em> is often an issue for me. For
example, I'm interested in studying many different languages. But
every minute I put towards studying Korean is a minute that <em>is not</em>
spent studying Chinese. Here, I just have to make a choice about what
I am prioritizing.</p>
<h3>Attention is the secret sauce</h3>
<p>Once you have some projects to work on, you need to put attention into
them.  Note that <em>attention</em> is different from <em>time</em>; you can put
lots of <em>time</em> into watching tutorial videos and learn
nothing. However, if you bring your attention to actively work on
problems, <em>you will learn</em>.</p>
<p>Oftentimes focusing attention means <em>turning off distractions</em>. You
may be surprised how much progress you can make <em>focusing</em> on some one
thing for not so much time, e.g. 15 minutes a day. If you had spent 15
minutes per day studying XYZ foreign language for the past 5 years, do
you reckon you'd know a lot by now?</p>
<p>It is when we get overwhelmed (often by our attention getting split)
that we fail to allocate attention, though we may spend a lot of
<em>time</em> suffering. It is easy to spend a miserable Saturday "kinda
studying" from 10 AM till 10 PM; perhaps 2 hours of concentrated
studying, interrupted by 6 hours of video games, followed by 2 more
hours of concentrated studying would be better. That is being honest
with oneself about the need to rest, recover, and "do nothing".</p>
<h3>If it helps, embrace tracking</h3>
<p>For some stuff, we value the "muh freedoms". For other work, being
tracked means documenting that you are working hard and trying to make
good use of your time.</p>
<h2>Know when to quit</h2>
<p>Completing projects through milestones you set can also be a good way
to decide when to <em>stop</em> some effort and spend your energies
elsewhere. For example, I spent some time studying
<a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>, Google's C++ alternative programing
language with a nice syntax. I worked through the exercises in the
official "<a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">A Tour of Go</a>"
documentation over a long while. Eventually, I realized that I didn't
really need Golang to solve the sorts of problems I was currently
facing; spending time on this language was also keeping me from making
progress learning other technologies like UNIX utils (<code>bash</code>, <code>find</code>,
<code>sed</code>, etc.) and improving my JavaScript. So I stopped studying Go
<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Organizing your projects&mdash;which involves "pruning" ones that are
no longer relevant to you&mdash; encourages pro-active decision making
in life. You can determine what is worth your attention and what is
not.</p>
<h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<p>You can improve on technical skills by having clearly defined
<em>projects</em> (which may in turn lead to many sub-projects). Keeping
inventory of which projects you have and making sure you always have
concrete goals to work towards ensures you are always improving your
skills or building some thing (material, social, etc.).</p>
<p>By selecting which projects you continue, marking off projects as
"complete", and sometimes pruning projects that aren't going anywhere,
you exercise agency over your life and will feel good. Likewise,
choosing <em>not to begin projects</em> is an exercise in confidently saying
"no" because you know your own stuff well. </p>
<p>Once you establish a good record for successfully completing projects,
your "YES" and your "NO" will both be well-respected by those who know
you because you will have established that you have a pattern of
planning, executing, and when necessary making clear decisions to abandon ship.</p>
