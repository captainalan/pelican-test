</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today I spent some time shuffling around items to prepare for the
summer heat. Arrangements of stuff that may be comfortable in cooler
times may be unpleasant in hotter times. Adjusting stuff with changing
seasons venerable behavior with a history older than air conditioning.</p>
<h2>Seasonal Adjustments</h2>
<p>Life on earth often revolves around <em>seasons</em> of some sort. Often, we
hear about <em>four seasons</em> from cultures of temperate climates <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, but
people in other climates may talk about a "wet season" and a "dry
season" instead. <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>To look at strategies for "beating the heat" we can turn to cultures
of hot weather places. Consider the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djellaba"><em>djellaba</em></a> of Northern
Africa&mdash;a "long, loose-fitting unisex outer robe with full
sleeves" (Wikip). This article of clothing is simultaneously cool (by
virtue of being loose-fitting) and offers some sun protection (through
having long sleeves, a baggy hood to protect from sun and sand blown
by strong desert winds).</p>
<h3>The human/cultural world</h3>
<p>Seasons apply not just to what plants you can grow and staying alive,
but also to fashion, marketing, and other urban activities.</p>
<p>In many ways, we are experiencing a <em>special COVID-19</em> season. The way
we dress/act/operate is responding to a change in the environment.
All of this is "cultural" in the sense that relatively few people are
directly influenced by the <em>biololgy</em> of COVID-19 directly, though
"seasonal talk" is buzzing with people figuring out what "the new
normal" is.</p>
<h3>Seasons of Solitude</h3>
<p>With the Internet and stuff, COVID-19 is a new thing. But the ideas of
<em>isolation</em> and <em>solitude</em> and <em>quarantine</em> are not new ideas. We can
learn about how humans have dealt with these things in the past by
studying documents from hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>In East Asia (China, Japan, Korea) there is lots of talk about
seasons; many Chinese things are named variations of "four
seasons" in English. A Japanese stereotype is to be "in touch with
nature", doing stuff like writing sensitive haikus about the
changing seasons.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I will need to do some more research on different cultures' treatments
of seasons. Future blog posts on this maybe...&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
