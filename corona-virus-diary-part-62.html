</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Computers (laptops, desktops) and smartphones are all <strong>tools</strong> which
can potentially be useful to us. Like a chainsaw, however, they can
also be dangerous. Reckless play with these things</p>
<h2>Too fast, too slow</h2>
<p>The computer I'm presently writing from isn't a particularly fast
computer. Using "modern" apps (e.g. web browsers, Discord) I have
crashed this computer many times. But if I stick to dinosaur-style
software usage (e.g. my text editor, browser without many tabs open),
then I'm fine.</p>
<p>However, for getting writing done, this is a very "fast" computer. I
use it as a digital typewriter/publishing machine as well as an
occasional dictionary.</p>
<p>If I were still a student and had a writing homework assignment, I
wouldn't hesitate to hop onto this computer to get stuff done. Trying
to get writing done on a super fast gaming rig with all sorts of fun
games and distracting apps would not be very conducive to hammering
out some prose.</p>
<h2>Identify the task at hand</h2>
<p>Rather than just hanging out with a computer, I've found that it is
helpful to first take a moment or so to <em>remember why I am</em> going on
the computer in the first place. The answer to this question could be
<em>to socialize</em> or <em>to play games</em>&mdash;what is important is that <em>you
recognize your intentions with using your tools (computer, phone,
etc.)</em> such that a few hours pass and regret how you spent your time.</p>
<p>With a computer, one can do many things:</p>
<h3>Rest/Play</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chat with friends, maintain networks/communications</li>
<li>Play video games</li>
<li>Experiment with software</li>
<li>Make memes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Study a foreign language</li>
<li>Read/annotate a book</li>
<li>Write programs to get work done</li>
<li>Organize files</li>
<li>Compile research into shareable writings</li>
<li>Do system maintenance</li>
<li>Data entry</li>
<li>Data processing, analysis (e.g. doing something useful with a
  spreadsheet)</li>
<li>Keeping a log/diary</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are many things you can do with a computer that
would likely be more difficult to do with only a pen/paper. Especially
when it comes to sharing the work you have done, digital information
technology is very useful.</p>
<h2>Distractions</h2>
<p>Computers <em>should not</em> be used as a distraction/coping mechanism. Are
you logging on the computer <em>to distract yourself from doing XYZ
chores?</em> It may be time to shut up, get up, and do the work that is in
front of you rather than <strong>derping</strong> around on the Internet.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you are getting caught up in some Internet
argument&mdash;you can ask yourself&mdash;"to what end am I doing
this?" If the answer to this question is to <em>stroke your ego (by
showing the world how smart you are)</em>, or to make somebody feel bad...
...well you should probably go do something else.</p>
<h2>Not a "Luddite"</h2>
<p>I'm not an advocate of just trashing all the technology and returning
to being a "caveman". However, I also think that we shouldn't
uncritically embrace new technology as "progress". </p>
<p>We're all living in a particular time and place&mdash;it is up to each
of us to choose to use what we've been given wisely.</p>
