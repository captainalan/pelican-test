</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Imagine yourself from a <em>third person perspective</em>&mdash;watch
yourself from someone else's viewpoint. What is this person like? Are
they acting in a self-destructive way? Are they good to others? Are
they idealistic but utterly incompetent? How would you describe
yourself in a novel?</p>
<p>The idea here is to look at yourself <strong>objectively</strong>. Putting aside
present feelings for a moment, how would you evaluate your behavior?</p>
<h2>Visualization Techniques</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you <em>see the money?!?!?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In lots of popular psychology and business type books, you will see
discussions of various flavors of <strong>visualization</strong> techniques. That
is, imagining various scenarios. The idea is that your sub-conscious
will then come up with ideas of how to arrive at these goals.</p>
<p>Unscientific? Nonsense? Bullshit? I think, not so much. It is hard to
quantify/measure the efficacy of techniques like visualization. But
the fact that so many people have been using</p>
<h2>A Recipe for Action</h2>
<p>Can you sit down and visualize yourself just philosophizing and
getting nothing done for hours on end? Chances are, you probably
cannot sustain this meditation for long. When I try this, my attention
drifts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the weather going to be like tomorrow? Oh.. must take a note
on something I want to write about later. My butt itches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visualization techniques get you thinking about what you <em>can</em>
do. What are the available actions I can do? What tools do I have at
my disposal?</p>
<h2>Quarantined Times</h2>
<p>It's LARPing time. You are in an RPG called life. Your character is
trapped for some time in a small dungeon. How will you train? What
skills will you level up? What connections will you make? Options are
many, and time (unlike Federal Reserve notes) is limited.</p>
